-Jewellery can be very underestimated. It is worth following. Poison resistance can be important and allows you to take on the ants and explore gnome/dark elf dungeons safely. This gives you extra resources from the ants and sometimes powerful items from dungeons, which become easier to explore if you can survive a snake bite. You also get access to amulets of regeneration which helps your minions survive, especially if you directly control them.
