-Unlocks: [[Pigsty]]
Build a pigsty for up to 4 extra population
-To follow the strategy further, make statues and build a throne (later on).
-If you want to try and overwhelm with numbers, you may lose or take heavy casualties, this is because the rogue-like underlying physics does tend to favour one OP hero over lots of little baddies (Rogue-likes are all about slaughtering armies of enemies with one guy if you think about it - and this is partly true with keeper).
-You can go for the converted prisoners route. Cyclops, knights, dwarves, converted bosses. A high population will ensure prisoners can't escape and provide you with a way of capturing and converting bulks of prisoners. You will also need to build a prison.
