''You get gold by mining gold veins.
''
You need to store gold pieces in a [[treasure chest]].
Gold is used to build [[:Installations#Statue|statues]]. It is the only way to seriously increase your population cap. Hoarding too much gold will attract [[: Bandit|bandits]], and the throne itself makes your neighbors hate you more.
The alternative but a surefire way of getting gold is by 
''luring attackers
'' into your keep and taking the ore from the bloody corpses, as they very often carry their purse with them. A defensive keep strategy will easily score a big gold count.
