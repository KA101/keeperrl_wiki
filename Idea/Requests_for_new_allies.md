Allies are split into humanoids, beasts and undead for convenience.

Greenskins / Humanoids (Sleep in beds)
======================================

Necromage
---------

-   Start level : 10
-   Strength : 30
-   Dexterity : 30
-   Speed : 20
-   Weight : light
-   Size : small
-   Unarmed attack bonus : 6
-   Attack : 30
-   Defence : 26
-   Accuracy : 40
-   Traits : Humanoid
-   Tasks: : Study, Training, Potions, Poison Immune (Raise dead)?
-   Concept: More of a Front line mage, something better than Orc
    Shaman,
-   Purpose in game: Evil Human Necromancer to have a Decent front line
    magic user that can be recruited, No heals, No mana production.
-   Optional features: Female to add a few more ladies to the ranks,
    Raise dead ability would be cool if it worked like summon flies but
    only when surrounded by corpses, Requirements could include having
    graves and/or a specific amount of undead. Balance to be the basic
    equal of a Vamp but can roam in the day time?
-   Discussion:
    -   Maybe could be orc necromancer, to follow the idea of using
        greenskins as your minions? Female orcish necromancer sounds
        good. :) Could Raise Undead to temporarily create zombies from
        all corpses nearby, but those corpses would burn to dust after
        being destroyed or a short time, thus not giving you infinite
        minions. --[Red kangaroo](/keeperrl_wiki/Player_Red_Kangaroo "wikilink")

Giant
-----

-   Start level : 15
-   Strength : 30
-   Dexterity : 5
-   Speed : 50
-   Weight : 5000
-   Size : HUGE
-   Unarmed attack bonus : 20
-   Attack : 30
-   Defence : 40
-   Accuracy : 10
-   Traits : Humanoid
-   Tasks: Sleep, Eat
-   Concept: A huge monster that does nothing but eat and sleep. Good at
    combat but poor accuracy.
-   Purpose in game: He is a good tank. High defense, if rather rubbish
    at hitting back on target.
-   Optional features: Recruit one per map only. Not a tribe.
-   Discussion:
    -   This could be difficult to pull off visually because all sprites
        take up the same space. It's already tricky to give mobs a sense
        of scale.
    -   Could we call it a troll as per Brogue-lore and make it a
        legendary greenskin? It would not be allowed to use ranged
        weapons, but it could carry heavy weaponry.

    -   I like the idea of this being a legendary greenskin troll, maybe
        even the leader of the village? --[Red
