Michal has indicated that he is interested in producing new content and
may adopt player ideas. This section is here to facilitate this.

-   Please keep the standard rules about not submitting copyrighted
    content to the wiki. This includes any material of your own for
    which you want the copyright. (We are submitting our ideas into the
    public domain for Michal to use under an open source license)

Thanks!

Please just edit the the correct Wiki page and feel free to try the
templates. Fill those out as best you can and post them underneath
existing stuff. The big strength of wikis is the ability to collaborate.
The templates are there to provoke ideas and structure the ideas (making
them easier to implement). Try not to remove ideas that have already
been written down, as this is probably counter-productive.

There may be some overlap between changing what the game contains (game
content) and changing the way the game is designed (game mechanics).
