Rebellion
---------

-   Locations: Anywhere
-   Concept: Rebellion. When asked to work endlessly without sleep, food
    or a good beating.
-   Concept: Minions lose morale when working endlessly. They get it
    back by eating and sleeping. (Although the situation can also be
    fixed by whipping them).
-   Concept: Creatures at the lowest level of morale don't do any
    crafting or training tasks.
-   Purpose: Management of morale could be interesting. If you don't
    want to manage it, just keep their sleeping, eating, whipping tasks
    ticked and they will naturally continue as always.
-   Suggested creatures that have this task: Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Orc
    Shaman, Harpy, Dark elves, Human legends
-   Optional features: Creatures turn hostile after 24 hours of being in
    rebellion.

Fishing
-------

-   Located in :Lakes, rivers, underwater lakes/rivers.
-   Benefit +1 population (one off) after catching fish.
-   Suggested creature: goblin
-   Task could take 500 turns to get the population boost.
-   Discussion: ....

Alluring Dance
--------------

-   Cooldown: 30/40 ticks
-   Concept: An ability for the Succubus, when used it will enthrall
    avery Humanoid target in view or within a certain distance.
    enthralled targets will basically be defenceless to an extent. they
    won't fight back, because they would be transfixed on the Succubus's
    shaking hips and alluring gaze ;)
-   Purpose in game: gives the succubus SOMETHING to defend herself
    with.
-   Optional features: This ability will entrance a number of enemy
    Humanoids in her way, this will make her hold in place for a few
    turns while she dances, for i'm thinking 6 or 7 tics and the enemies
    will be enthralled for 5 or 6 tics after wards so as to give the
    succubus a chance to escape.
-   Discussion:

Enchanting
----------

-   Concept: Enchant weapons with spell properties.

Weapon spells would activate on attack and have a CD. Examples: An
enchanted bow that makes every 3rd arrow fired a explosive one, a dagger
that burns its opponent every 4th atack, or cast haste on its wielder
etc... (or it could be probability based)

-   Extra awesomeness if you could inscribe the items with a special
    name in/or description to conmemorate the event.
-   Optional features: armor enhancements
