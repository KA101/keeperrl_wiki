Ring of Sacrificial Power
-------------------------

-   Weight: 0.3
-   Defence : 0
-   Price: N/A -- **MUST BE FOUND**
-   Type: Ring
-   Special Powers: *The Cycle of Sacrifice*. The *Cycle* is an ancient
    ritual that is performed by the wearers of the ring. In order to
    wear the ring in its dormant state, the current owner needs to be
    killed. Once the owner is killed, the current *Cycle* ends and a new
    ritual begins. The next living creature to wear the ring is
    sacrificed, their life drained instantly down to zero. The next
    wearer is granted these life points as bonus damage on their next
    casted ability. Once the spell is casted, 1% of the life used is
    permanently kept within the ring to further boost spells in the
    future on top of the next sacrifice's life points. After the cast is
    complete and the permanent life is stored, the ring may be given to
    the next sacrifice to continue the current Cycle.
    -   Math: (Sacrificed Health + Permanent Bonus) = Total Bonus
        Ability Damage
    -   Example: ONE HUNDRED 10-health creatures have been sacrificed
        during the length of the current Cycle. A new 10-health creature
        is sacrificed. (10 + 100) = 110 Total Bonus Ability Damage

-   Optional features: The eyes of the wearer (not sacrifice) grow a
    brighter red with each sacrifice.
