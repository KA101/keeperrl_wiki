    (/keeperrl_wiki/[talk](/keeperrl_wiki/User_TalkOwen "wikilink")) 03:23, 1 April 2017 (/keeperrl_wiki/UTC)
-   I agree (/keeperrl_wiki/Sounds_Good)_[Keeperman](/keeperrl_wiki/Player_Keeperman "wikilink")
-   What about diseases, eg. tropical fever that affects living
    creatures and causes lowered speed and accuracy, but does not
    actually kill? --[Red kangaroo](/keeperrl_wiki/Player_Red_Kangaroo "wikilink")
