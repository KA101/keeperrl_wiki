Summary
=======

These creatures are deadly with a bow and arrow. They can be taken
prisoner at night using a team with bats, so that you have the better
vision compared to theirs. If you don't want to take prisoners, normally
players will simply burn down their forest and plunder all the bows and
corpses left over.
