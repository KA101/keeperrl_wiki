* Concept: Undead with weapon skills. Better at fighting than vampires but no spells.
* Purpose in game: Fill a gap in your undead army with weapon malee.
* Optional features: One day, perhaps the different corpses would yield different skeletons
* Discussion: There is already an unused skeleton sprite in the game. I think that this could be particularly interesting if you could only spawn skeletons from corpses but they didn't effect your unit count and couldn't level or use gear. Perhaps the level could be based on the level of the corpse they spawn from?
