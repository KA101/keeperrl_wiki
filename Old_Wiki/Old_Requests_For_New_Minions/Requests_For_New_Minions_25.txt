* Purpose in game: Fill a gap in your undead army with weapon malee.
* Optional features: One day, perhaps the different corpses would yield different skeletons
* Discussion: There is already an unused skeleton sprite in the game. I think that this could be particularly interesting if you could only spawn skeletons from corpses but they didn't effect your unit count and couldn't level or use gear. Perhaps the level could be based on the level of the corpse they spawn from?
* Discussion: So could be a permanent minion or a temporary pet (Like flies). These could be two separate creatures with the same spite. The permanent minion could train etc. The temporary pet could turn back to bones after so many turns.

* Purpose in game: To sow true discord among the enemy.
* Optional features: The Shade will appear similarly to the ghost, except it will be dark purple in color with Glowing Red (or green) eyes. it won't be as fragile as the Ghost however and would be able to take a few hits before it is dispersed.
