Please fill out the structure below. For stats &quot;Terrible&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Excellent&quot; will do as much as numbers.

Minions categorised below by where they sleep:

= Humanoid (Sleep in beds)= 
== Slave master ==
*Start Level: 10
*Strength: 35
*Dexterity: 15
*Speed: 25
*Weight: 20
*Size: Fat
*Unarmed attack bonus: 5
*Attack: 10
*Defence: 10
*Accuracy: 15
*Traits: Humanoid
*Tasks: Slave Marketing, training, eating, sleeping
*Attractions: Slave Market (See requests for new rooms)
*Concept: For Slave Market. Otherwise, similar to a normal orc warrior when in combat.
*Purpose in game: Source of money
*Optional Features:

Has a 3% chance that if he injures a beast unit (Ants, etc) No dragons... thats OP..... That if you have a beast cage... the beast unit will be yours.

==Beastmaster==
*I don't know the stats and balancing nearly well enough to give stats. 
*Tasks: Sleeping, Training, Beast Training
*Attractions: Beasts and Beast Cages. Would like a Beast Pit room for training beasts.
*Concept: A large near-feral orc or ogre covered in fur and hides with an infatuation for beasts. Will train beasts.
*Optional Features: Grants beasts an obedience buff for being in the same team as beasts.

==Other recruitable humanoids==
-Good minions: (Hyena-man, Fiends)

=Undead (Sleep in graves) =

== Skeleton (Implemented in Alpha 23) ==
* Start level : 4
* Strength : 10
* Dexterity : 15
* Speed : 80
* Weight : 50
* Size : medium
* Unarmed attack bonus : 10
* Attack : 10
* Defense : 15
* Accuracy : 15
* Traits : Humanoid, Undead, Brainless, No corpse
* Skills : Weapon Melee
* Tasks: : Train, Sleep in graveyard
* Attractions: Training room + graveyard
* Concept: Undead with weapon skills. Better at fighting than vampires but no spells.
* Purpose in game: Fill a gap in your undead army with weapon melee.
* Optional features: One day, perhaps the different corpses would yield different skeletons
* Discussion: There is already an unused skeleton sprite in the game. I think that this could be particularly interesting if you could only spawn skeletons from corpses but they didn't effect your unit count and couldn't level or use gear. Perhaps the level could be based on the level of the corpse they spawn from?
* Discussion: So could be a permanent minion or a temporary pet (Like flies). These could be two separate creatures with the same spite. The permanent minion could train etc. The temporary pet could turn back to bones after so many turns.

== Mummy (Implemented in Alpha 26) ==
* Start level : 3
* Stats: weak at combat with slow training but can train very many levels
* Optional features: Suicide unit that blows itself up (Not implemented in Alpha 26)

==Lesser Lich==

*Concept: Lesser version of Lich. High health. Can only raise two temp skeletons at a time. Cannot make other liches.
*Optional features: Linked with master lich's phlactery.

==Abomination==
*I don't know the stats and balancing nearly well enough to give stats.

*Concept: Ungodly humanoid created by infusing necromatic energy into a living being while they are near death. Creates insane, intelligent zombies. High health, high attack, normal speed. Disturbs all living creatures, including your own minions, and presence lowers moral of living creatures. Enemies have chance to flee upon gaining visibility.

==Ghoul==
*I don't know the stats and balancing nearly well enough to give stats. Cannot use equipment.
*Tasks: Sleeping, Eating, Canibalizing, Drooling, Sleeping
*Attractions: Graveyard with corpses and limbs
*Concept:Strong feral undead that only obeys as long as there are bodies and limbs to eat. If there are no bones or corpses to be found in graveyard, attacks nearest minions until sated. Minions become hostile during this time. Possible for ghouls to be killed by minions at this time/vice versa.
