== Summary ==
These are the inhabitants of many a forest in our land. When they die, they leave behind wood that can be plundered. Because they are slow creatures, a tribe of tree spirits can be killed fairly easily by a well equipped werewolf, which can gain up to about 6 levels for it. They can be rather good xp.

Tree spirits can be set on fire, and will actively seek out water to put it out.
