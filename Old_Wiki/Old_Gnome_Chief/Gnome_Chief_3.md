== Summary ==

They are excellent at making good jewelry quickly and settle as tribes in random dungeons found in the mountains. Keepers that can't be bothered to make peace with the little folk are often accustomed to over-powering them and taking them back to the dungeon in chains. Otherwise, the dungeons are quite interesting and can contain rare items and monsters.
