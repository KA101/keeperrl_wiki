The Torture Room is where you torture your prisoners, and generate extra mana through the torture of said prisoners. Make sure your torture room is well lit for maximum efficiency!  To begin torturing your prisoner, select your prisoner and change his task from Prison to Torture.  He will go to the torture room, and a minion SHOULD be on the way to abuse him.  Be warned, most prisoners will not survive the torturing for any effective bit of mana.  However, it appears Succubus are the most effective torturers, and they on average WILL generate a sizable amount of mana.
