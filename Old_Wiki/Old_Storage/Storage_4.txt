There are currently 3 types of storage tiles: ''material'', which store [[:Resources|resources]], ''equipment'' which store [[:Category:Items|items]], and ''everything'' that can hold any of the above.

Storage tiles are free to build and have no upper limit.

== The [[:Graveyard|graveyard]] stockpile ==
While it certainly is the resting place of many of our [[:Traits#Undead|undead]] friends, it is also a the stockpile for corpses, which means you should always have free tile for the lovely bones.

== Tips ==
As of [[:Category:Alpha15|alpha15]] there seem to be no upper limit to what a tile can store, which means that 1 tile of ''everything'' can virtually hold... everything.

You can use this trick for a single [[:Graveyard|graveyard]] tile, provided you are ready to see your graveyard disappear if you have room in your population cap and a zombie feels like joining. Alternatively you can always have 2, and make it grow with every joiner without risking a rotting accident in your keep.
