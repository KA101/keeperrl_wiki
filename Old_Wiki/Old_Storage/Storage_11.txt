=Treasure Chest=
*Holds your gold
* Each chest can hold unlimited gold pieces, so multiple chests are able to spread the gold into different locations or just provide decoration.
* Treasure chests are built from the storage menu.

==Tile Cost==
[[File:treasurydeco.png|100px|link=]] ''5 wood per treasure chest

==Usage==
Treasure chests empty as gold is used:
*Building statues, carpets, demonshrines.
*Recruitment of special units
*Creatures in older versions of KeeperRL used to require salaries, but this is no longer the case.

=Other storage=

There are currently 2 other types of storage tiles: ''material'', which store [[:Resources|resources]], ''equipment'' which store [[:Category:Items|items]]

Storage tiles are free to build and have no upper limit.
*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0f0&quot;&gt;Material stockpiles are coloured green&lt;/span&gt;
*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0000ff&quot;&gt;Equipment stockpiles are coloured blue&lt;/span&gt;

== The [[:Graveyard|graveyard]] stockpile ==
[[File:gravedeco.png|100px|link=]] ''Corpses

While it certainly is the resting place of many of our [[:Traits#Undead|undead]] friends, it is also a the stockpile for corpses, which means you should always have free tile for the lovely bones.

== Tips ==
There seems to be no upper limit to what a tile can store, which means that 1 tile of ''everything'' can virtually hold... everything.

You can use this trick for a single [[:Graveyard|graveyard]] tile, provided you are ready to see your graveyard disappear if you have room in your population cap and a zombie feels like joining. Alternatively you can always have 2, and make it grow with every joiner without risking a rotting accident in your keep.
