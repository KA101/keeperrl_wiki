==Summary==

This creature is famous for its ability to absorb other dungeon inhabitants and so doing, gain many of their characteristics and skills. They start off fairly weak but power up as they absorb other prisoners and minions. Try not to absorb things with negative characteristics since the likely outcome is that your doppleganger will exhibit those traits as well.
