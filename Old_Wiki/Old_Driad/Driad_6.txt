= Summary =
These creatures are deadly with a bow and arrow. They can be taken prisoner at night using a team with bats, so that you have the better vision compared to theirs. If you don't want to take prisoners, normally players will simply burn down their forest and plunder all the bows and corpses left over.

They may appear to be a force for goodness in the world. While it is true that they never assault dungeons or keeps, the reality is that they shoot down tresspassers like they are judge, jury and executioner. Justice is not really their thing.
