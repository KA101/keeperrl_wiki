=About Realtime Strategy=

KeeperRL has an overhead view that progresses without players taking individual turns to move. You move minions and build rooms and installations while a clock ticks away. You can select 4 different clock speeds from slow to fast. You can also pause the game. You must manage and defend your dungeon from invaders. You can recruit additional minions and take prisoners - and torture them to convert them. As time progresses, you move from day into nighttime and back to daytime etc. Gameplay is somewhat impacted by the time of day or night, including night vision and death of undead in sunlight. You develop technology as you defeat enemies and must gather resources and loot equipment. In this game mode, KeeperRL features indirect control of your minions and works as a dungeon management game. The interface is pretty neat and there is a good amount of complexity in the game design.
