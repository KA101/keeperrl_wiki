== Summary ==
Best ranged fighter in the game. You come up against these human archers when attacking castles. You are likely to get shot down if you are careless when approaching them. These are the &quot;good&quot; guys or else they think they are the good guys but the truth is that only the really holy ones die before realising they are fully capable of wickedness after all. Of course, this is a lesson learnt at the torture table back in your dungeon where they are rather less smug.
