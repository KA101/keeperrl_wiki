Description: ''Spot for hauling dead bodies and for Undead creatures to sleep in.''

This is the dormitory of the Undead: [[File:graveyard.png|200px|thumb|right|A small Graveyard for Undead spawning and Corpse Collection.]]
*[[Zombie|Zombies]]
*[[Vampire|Vampires]] 
*[[Skeleton|Skeletons]]

Imps bury the corpses of the dead here.

== Attraction ==

All Undead need a free space grave and a fresh corpse to [[Immigration|spawn]].

== Tile Cost ==
15 Stone

== Tips ==

*Undead will still make a Graveyard their home if there are bones collected on it.
*Graveyards have no limit to the amount of bones that can be piled on them. If you don't need Undead and just need to store corpses, one Graveyard is sufficient.
