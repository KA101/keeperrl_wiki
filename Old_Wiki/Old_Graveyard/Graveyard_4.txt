Description: ''Corpses are dragged here. Sometimes an Undead creature makes their home here.''

This is the dormitory of the Undead:
*[[Zombie|Zombies]]
*[[Vampire|Vampires]]
*[[Skeletons|Skeletons]]

Imps bury the corpses of the dead here.

== Attraction ==

All Undead need a free space for their grave and a fresh corpse in the graveyard to [[Immigration|spawn]].

== Tile Cost ==
15 Granite

== Tips ==

* Be careful of the '''infinite Undead spawn'''! As you ''always'' need a free tile to pile up corpses, every now and then a [[:Zombie|zombie]] will pop if the population cap allows it. This can quickly deplete your [[:Resources#Granite|granite]] stocks, and build you an army of very slow warriors. If needed, a lemming death (control &gt; voluntary jump into water) can temporarily solve the problem. Alternatively, control an imp to get rid of the damn butchered things outside: no corpse, no new friend.
* Always make a [[:Installations#Door|door]] to close up a room with corpses, such as the graveyard or the [[:Pigsty|pigsty]], to avoid the gas spread that can wound and poison your minions.
