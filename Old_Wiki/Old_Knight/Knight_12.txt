== Summary ==
Knights are rock hard hand-to-hand fighting units. When equipped with a decent weapon and good armour, even more so. They are great to capture and convert. They also provide the opportunity to give melee resistance when absorbed by a doppleganger, although you will be tempted to use them as warriors in their own right. These are usually end-game heroes, so don't be surprised if your large band of ogres and orcs get slaughtered like sheep. You will probably need something special to take these out.
