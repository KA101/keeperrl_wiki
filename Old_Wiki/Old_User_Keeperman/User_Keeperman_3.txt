I should probably introduce myself. I am a fellow gamer who also likes to play with the code. I write mods for Keeper and desperately try to get them past quality into the actual game :) I am always interested in gaining new technical skills through hobby coding.

I have no special status or authority, so you can ignore me whenever you want to. :)
