Z-Levels are opened up when building a down staircase from your dungeon.

 Note that the map is 3D and has a vertical axis, which can be viewed one 2D cross section at a time.

You may only build one down staircase and that staircase will link to the middle of the next z-level. Portals do not work across z-levels. In this regard, z-levels are not done in the same way as certain other games (including Dwarf Fortress). 

The current vanilla configuration is found here:

This is the current vanilla configuration shown as a table.

You can keep digging down forever.
