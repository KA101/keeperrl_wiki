*Attributes:Kraken stats

=Summary=
Lives in lakes and rivers and entangles passers-by. Krakens are the only multi-tile monster being made of a head and tentacles with a submerged and invisible body. You may need to kill the head with a specially chosen flying unit because normally the tentacles just keep coming and often there can be no escape.
