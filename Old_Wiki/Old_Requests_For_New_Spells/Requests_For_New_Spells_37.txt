*Concept: Necromancy/Summoning
*Purpose in game: To make a fun way to play, like trying to solo-raid with one mage.
*Optional features: Custom zombies for each mob, maybe even skeleton things.
*Discussion: (Keeperman) A number of different options to implement this:
-Could raise the first corpse on the pile you are standing on.

-Could use the directional arrow to target a corpse in your line of site

-Could raise up to 3 nearby corpses. etc.

-Zombie level, spell cool down, duration of pets can be balanced to ensure it works really well.

== Discord ==
* Magic school: Advanced Sorcery
* Special powers: Generally speaking, modulates hostility between target creatures

* Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

* Purpose in game:

== Magic Missile ==

* Magic school: Advanced
* Special powers: Spellcaster casts a ball of energy that takes a few turns to reach its target (which it homes in on)
* Cooldown: 100
* Concept: Allows spell-casters to perform ranged damage, but also allows targets to hide
* Optional Features: Magic missile can come in several flavors, dealing various types of damage or on hit effects

== Magic Mine ==

* Magic school: Advanced
* Special powers: Spellcaster (or goblin) buries a hidden mine that is activated whenever enemies come near it.  When it is activated, it attack-moves towards the nearest enemy.
* Cooldown: 100 (active number of magic mines is limited per caster)
* Purpose in game: Mines are not &quot;traps,&quot; but suicidal units that can be placed in non-home zones.  They allow a spellcaster to support fighting units by zoning out enemies.
* Concept: These act like spider mines from Starcraft Brood War (but just modified a bit to fit the theme of KeeperRL). Because mines have to catch up to their target, they can be cleverly disarmed by using one unit to kite them while another ranged-attacker shoots them from a distance.  Detecting units can also detect burrowed mines so that ranged units can pick them off safely from outside the mine's trigger range.

== Summon Tree Spirit ==
* Magic school: Advanced

* Discussion:

== Regrow Limb ==
* Magic school: Master Sorcery.
* Special powers: Regrow one random, or all limbs.
* Cooldown: 500 (could also take a long time to cast).
* Concept: Really powerfull mages can create life? Well, why not create arms and legs! (Possibly even heads for vampires!)
* Purpose in game: One of the most annoying things might just be losing limbs with powerfull units, making them next to useless, this would make it possible to fully recover from injury as lost arms or legs.
* Optional features: Maybe have a potion as well (or only). Which could cost up to 1000 mana.
* Discussion:

== Alluring Dance ==
* Magic school: Ability 
* Cooldown: 3o/40 ticks 
* Concept: An ability for the Succubus, when used it will enthrall avery Humanoid target in view or within a certain distance. enthralled targets will basically be defenceless to an extent. they won't fight back, because they would be transfixed on the Succubus's shaking hips and alluring gaze ;)
* Purpose in game: gives the succubus SOMETHING to defend herself with.
* Optional features: This ability will entrance a number of enemy Humanoids in her way, this will make her hold in place for a few turns while she dances, for i'm thinking 6 or 7 tics and the enemies will be enthralled for 5 or 6 tics after wards so as to give the succubus a chance to escape. 
* Discussion:
