Bullet points to flesh out your ideas:
*Magic school: Do you get it from basic sorcery, advanced sorcery, master sorcery or a new technology altogether?
*Special powers: What does the spell actually do?
*Cooldown : Do you have to wait a long time for the spell to be reused again?
*Concept: What is the logic behind this and how does it belong in an RPG?
*Purpose in game: Why is this unique/different from other spells?
*Optional features: What extra things might make it even better?

List the suggestions below:

=Necromancy=
Necromancy is a popular theme among players. This is only one version of how to make it work.

== Undead cloud ==
* Magic school: Master Necromancy
* Special powers: Surrounds the caster with a cloud of poisonous gas.
* Cooldown : 500
* Concept: Poison your foes using a cloud of death gas.
* Purpose in game: A decent combat spell with a large cool-down 
* Optional features: 
1) Put it in a new necromancy school instead of the existing master sorcery school.
New magic schools only accessible by finding a technology book.
2) Give caster temporary poison resistance.
* Discussion:

== Raise corpse ==
*Magic school: Basic _necromancy_ (Cooldown = 500, zombies only, duration 100)
*Magic school: Advanced _necromancy_ (Cooldown = 400, zombies, skeletons, duration 150)
*Magic school: Master _necromancy_ (Cooldown = 300, zombies, skeletons and vampires, duration 200) 
*Special powers: Resurrects a corpse as a zombie at its level minus 3. Different levels take higher magic schools.
*Cooldown : 400 +/- 100
*Concept: Necromancy/Summoning
*Purpose in game: To make a fun way to play, like trying to solo-raid with one mage.
*Optional features: Custom zombies for each mob, skeleton things and custom vampires.
*Discussion: (Keeperman) 3 different ways to implement this. Could have 3 different spells or choose one:

*1-Could raise the first corpse on the pile you are standing on.
*2-Could use the directional arrow to target a corpse in your line of site
*3-Could raise up to 3 nearby corpses.

Evil_Lee03 I like option 3

-Zombie level, spell cool down, duration of pets can be balanced to ensure it works really well.

=Basic sorcery additions=

== Detection ==
* Magic school: Basic
* Special powers: allows unit to detect cloaked or otherwise hidden units or structures
* Cooldown: 100
* Discussion: Can either be in a radius around a unit or as an area of effect over targetted tiles
* Discussion: Can be done by temporarily giving the unit a disarming skill for 20 turns.

=Advanced sorcery additions=

== Night vision ==
* Magic school: Advanced Sorcery
* Special powers: Temporarily lets you see in the dark
* Cooldown : 30
* Concept: Temporary night vision
* Purpose in game: This may get you out of a tight spot or let you target enemies with a bow, which were normally not visible 
* Optional features: Different magic school.

== Discord ==
* Magic school: Advanced Sorcery
* Special powers: Generally speaking, modulates hostility between target creatures
* Cooldown : (variable)
* Concept: Like in Brogue, the idea is that discordant units will attack any unit in the vicinity, even friendly ones.
* Purpose in game: It doesn't exist.
* Optional features: Various types of discordance (i.e., only discordant against humanoids, beasts, elementals, etc).
* Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

== Magic Missile ==

* Magic school: Advanced
* Special powers: Spellcaster casts a ball of energy that takes a few turns to reach its target (which it homes in on)
* Cooldown: 100
* Concept: Allows spell-casters to perform ranged damage, but also allows targets to hide
* Optional Features: Magic missile can come in several flavors, dealing various types of damage or on hit effects

== Summon Elemental ==
* Magic school: Advanced
* Special powers: This is a family of spells that allow the spellcaster to summon an elemental unit that exists for a defined period of time

- Earth elementals can be summoned from any mountain wall 
- Air elementals can be summoned on any outdoor tile 
- Fire elementals can be summoned either from magma or from a burning tile 
* Cooldown: 200
* Purpose in game: Allows spell caster to cleverly use terrain in order to gain tactical advantage

== Magic Mine ==

* Magic school: Advanced
* Special powers: Spellcaster (or goblin) buries a hidden mine that is activated whenever enemies come near it.  When it is activated, it attack-moves towards the nearest enemy.
* Cooldown: 100 (active number of magic mines is limited per caster)
* Purpose in game: Mines are not &quot;traps,&quot; but suicidal units that can be placed in non-home zones.  They allow a spellcaster to support fighting units by zoning out enemies.
* Concept: These act like spider mines from Starcraft Brood War (but just modified a bit to fit the theme of KeeperRL). Because mines have to catch up to their target, they can be cleverly disarmed by using one unit to kite them while another ranged-attacker shoots them from a distance.  Detecting units can also detect burrowed mines so that ranged units can pick them off safely from outside the mine's trigger range.

== Summon Tree Spirit ==
* Magic school: Advanced
* Special powers: Turns an ordinary tree into a fearsome Tree sprit for 50 turns (or an amount of time dependent on ability power)
* Cooldown: 200

* Discussion:

=Elite sorcery (new tech)=

== Regrow Limb ==
* Magic school: Elite sorcery
* Special powers: Regrow one random, or all limbs.
* Cooldown: 500 (could also take a long time to cast).
* Concept: Really powerfull mages can create life? Well, why not create arms and legs! (Possibly even heads for vampires!)
* Purpose in game: One of the most annoying things might just be losing limbs with powerfull units, making them next to useless, this would make it possible to fully recover from injury as lost arms or legs.
