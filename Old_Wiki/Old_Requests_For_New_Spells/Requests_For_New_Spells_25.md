== Night vision ==
* Magic school: Sorcery
* Special powers: Temporarily lets you see in the dark
* Cooldown : 30
* Concept: Temporary night vision
* Purpose in game: This may get you out of a tight spot or let you target enemies with a bow, which were normally not visible 
* Optional features: Different magic school.

== Undead cloud ==
* Magic school: Master sorcery
* Special powers: Surrounds the caster with a cloud of poisonous gas.
* Cooldown : 500
* Concept: Poison your foes using a cloud of death gas.
* Purpose in game: A decent combat spell with a large cool-down 
* Optional features: 
1) Put it in a new necromancy school instead of the existing master sorcery school.
New magic schools only accessible by finding a technology book.

2) Give caster temporary poison resistence.
* Discussion:

== Dark Persuasion ==
* Magic school: Master sorcery
* Special powers: Turns hostile creatures neutral and neutral creatures friendly. Doesn't work on undead. Must be next to the creature. Small chance of success. The creature will use its turn to attack you if you fail. Tough creatures are even harder to persaude.
* Cooldown : 3000 - once per day
* Concept: Most creatures can be won over with magic and persistence. Don't be fooled though, it is hard work.
* Purpose in game: Really cool to win over creatures that you normally would never get in your dungeon.
* Optional features: Put it in a new psychic magic school instead of master sorcery.
New magic schools only accessible by finding a technology book.
* Discussion:

== Grow trees ==
* Magic school: Sorcery
* Special powers: Create some trees nearby.
* Cooldown : 150 and also costs some mana (unlike most spells)
* Concept: Magic can grow trees if you know how to do it.
* Purpose in game: Protect yourself from ranged attacks. Small source of wood.
* Optional features: 
Put it in a new nature school instead of the existing sorcery school.
New magic schools only accessible by finding a technology book.
* Discussion:

== !Change Places! ==
* Magic school: Advanced Sorcery
* Special powers: Swaps the positions of two team members
* Cooldown : 150
* Concept: Strategically repositioning team members
* Purpose in game: Nothing else works like this
* Optional features: Variants could also swap two enemy creatures, or just two of any creature
* Variant: Use the directional arrows to swap places with any creature in your line of site (Friend or foe).
* Discussion:

== Firestorm ==
* Magic school: New magic school. &quot;Vengence&quot; perhaps.
* Special powers: Blasts things nearby with a firestorm. Trees and bushes will catch fire. It will also burn you if you are not fire immune.
* Cooldown : 500
* Concept: Blast everything. Hurt friend and foe alike.
* Purpose in game: More spell variety. Different monsters with different spells.
* Optional features: The vengence techology and spell school could be for legendary humans not keepers. ie. They have different spells.
* Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

== Necromancy ==

*Magic school: All (Spell gets stronger with latest research)
*Special powers: Resurrects a corpse as a zombie at its level minus 3. Different levels take higher magic schools.
*Cooldown : 400
*Concept: Necromancy/Summoning
*Purpose in game: To make a fun way to play, like trying to solo-raid with one mage.
*Optional features: Custom zombies for each mob, maybe even skeleton things.
*Discussion: (Keeperman) A number of different options to implement this:
-Could raise the first corpse on the pile you are standing on.
-Could use the directional arrow to target a corpse in your line of site
-Could raise up to 3 nearby corpses. etc.

== Discord ==
* Magic school: Advanced Sorcery
* Special powers: Generally speaking, modulates hostility between target creatures
* Cooldown : (variable)
* Concept: Like in Brogue, the idea is that discordant units will attack any unit in the vicinity, even friendly ones.
* Purpose in game: It doesn't exist.
* Optional features: Various types of discordance (i.e., only discordant against humanoids, beasts, elementals, etc).
* Discussion: Discuss the idea here.


== Invisible wall ==
* Magic school: Perhaps a new spell school rather than just sorcery.
* Special powers: You choose a direction and the spell creates an invsible wall in front of you for 5-10 turns
* Cooldown : 100
* Concept: Create a magic barrier between you and an enemy
* Purpose in game: Defensive magic, to let you play for time.
* Optional features: The barrier could be visible
* Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

== Windstorm ==
* Magic school: ?
* Special powers: Area of effect spell; penalizes projectile accuracy if the projectile passes through affected tiles. Also increases fire spread/damage from flames.
* Cooldown : 200
* Concept: Provides protection from ranged units
* Purpose in game: 
* Optional features:
Slows down lightweight creatures?
Blows away poisonous gas?
Damages flying units?
Turns tiles blue?
Persists a while?
Spreads a bit after trap triggers?
* Discussion: Discuss the idea here.
