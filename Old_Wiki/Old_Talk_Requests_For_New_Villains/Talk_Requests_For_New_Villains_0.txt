Not so much as a request for new villains, but for more wandering enemies to attack your lair/keep.  Currently, if I stay in my keep and not attack, I can build up to tier 3 dummies and have my minions almost maxxed without being attacked once.  I usually reach that point around turn 17000.  I'm thinking that wandering enemies attacking around every 1000 turns and have their level/difficulty increase like every 2000 turns.  You can use an uploaded player's adventurers as a wandering enemy.  Just a thought.
