[[File:Team Control.png]]

==Mode 1: Ignore enemies==
*Stop your troops running off all over the place chasing enemies.
*If you don't have this set, they will break ranks and charge at all enemies.

==Mode 2: Stand ground==
*Get your troops into a standing formation
*Only the leader moves
*Switch leader and position everything as you want it
*Leave a defensive block at a useful place and attack with the leader.
*Tell a healer or defensive block to stand ground in a safe place while the leader attacks. Then return to the healer to get healed.
*As you come under attack you can switch leader and keep a defensive block.
*The formation of the standing army is broken after they follow their leader again.

==Mode 3: Neither Ignoring enemies nor standing ground==
*Chase enemies
*Good for mopping up fleeing enemies, if you don't want any to escape

=Full control mode=
*Control each unit in turn
*Press &quot;w&quot; to wait until other units have moved
