==Mode 1: Ignore enemies==
*Stop your troops running off all over the place chasing enemies.

==Mode 2: Stand ground==
*Get your troops into a standing formation
*Only the leader moves
*Leave a defensive block at a useful place and attack with the leader.
*Tell a healer to stand ground in a safe place while the leader attacks. Then return to the healer to get healed.
*When the leader is wounded he can return to the stationary units and get healed.
*As you come under attack you can switch leader and keep a defensive block.
*The formation of the standing army is not held at all after they follow their leader again.

*Chase enemies
*Good if you don't want any to escape
