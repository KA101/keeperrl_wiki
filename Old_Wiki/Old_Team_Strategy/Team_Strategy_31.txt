=Choosing the battlefield=
*Work out what triggers your enemy and when they will and won't attack.
*Try to work out if you would like to take them out in your home dungeon with the benefit of traps and creative dungeon designs.
*Don't let creatures that will set things on fire, come into your dungeon and burn it down!
*Single creatures or small tribes can be outnumbered, these are usually better taken down in the open outside where they can be surrounded.
*Large armies are often best dealt with in confined spaces where they can't surround you.
*Prisoners can be taken from a large tribe more easily if they are on your own soil, otherwise you may need to defeat the whole tribe before you can capture them.
*Losing a raid isn't the end of the game, losing your entire dungeon probably is. Difficult tribes are sometimes better to be raided.

==Mode 2: Stand ground==

*Only the leader moves
*Switch leader and position everything as you want it
*Leave a defensive block at a useful place and attack with the leader.
