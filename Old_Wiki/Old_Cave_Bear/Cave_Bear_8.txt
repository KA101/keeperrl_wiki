==Summary==

They are dark beasts, which keepers can recruit and control. Cave bears are decent starter combat units and will also explore your dungeon map sector for you. They have been known to wipe out local villages on their own initiative. They do not however, provoke revenge from the tribes they attack. Instead they attack anonymously as if acting on a random instinct.
