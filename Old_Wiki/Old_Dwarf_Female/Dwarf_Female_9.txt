== Summary ==
Not all dwarves are fighters and once the trouble-makers have been dealt with, these creatures are excellent diggers. She is short and very cute but more importantly can mine all that gold you need deeper down in your dungeon. They are easier to take alive because they do not take up arms unlike their menfolk. They act as civilians rather than fighters and usually run away from invaders. Neither do they take part in attacking settlements. However, if you do convert them to your dungeon then their combat stats are as good as any male.
