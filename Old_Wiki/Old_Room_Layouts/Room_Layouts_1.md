Soon in the game you discover that not only 1-tile rooms are in most cases not very effective, but different rooms behave differently as you grow them.

== Bordered room ==
Almost a default: many rooms are most efficient at their center.

They display little props to show that property: training dummies for the [[:Training Room|training room]], bookshelves for the [[:Library|library]]... That means the most efficient way to grow them is to have the shortest border to content ratio!

{| style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;

|-
|colspan=&quot;3&quot;|The shape changes things a bit:
|colspan=&quot;3&quot;|Though size also matters (no pun here).

|-
|'''Long room'''
|
 ////////
 /######/
 ////////
|3x8 (24) tiles

6 at 100% + 18 at 50%

= power of 15 tiles for the cost of 24

= '''62.5% efficient'''

|'''Small room'''
|
 ///
 /#/
 ///
|3x3 (9) tiles

1 at 100% + 8 at 50%

= power of 5 tiles for the cost of 9

= '''55.6% efficient'''

|-
|'''Squar-ish room'''
|
 /////
 /###/
 /###/
 /###/
 /////
|5x5 (25) tiles

9 at 100% + 16 at 50%

= power of 17 tiles for the cost of 24

= '''70.8% efficent'''

|'''Big room'''
|
 ///////
 /#####/
 /#####/
 /#####/
 /#####/
 /#####/
 ///////
|7x7 (49) tiles

25 at 100% + 24 at 50%

= power of 37 tiles for the cost of 49

= '''75.6% efficent'''
|}

So bigger is more effective, and square is more effective. To be able to grow effectively you sort of need to leave ''some space'' around the rooms you are planning to upgrade at some point.

== Striped rooms ==
Some rooms ([[:Dormitory|dorm]], [[:Graveyard|graveyard]]...) have a strange stripe-like efficiency: only ''odd rows will ever be inhabited''.

{|
|Thus, a big dorm ('H' where the actual beds are)
|is more costly and as efficient than 2 small ones:
|-
|
 HHHHH
 /////
 HHHHH
|
 HHHHH
 
 HHHHH
|}
