This construction can only be built once, after you defeated a tribe. It immediately adds 10 to your population cap, and makes the other tribes hate you more. But they're probably just jealous.

== Requirements ==
You need to have conquered at least one of the local tribes. (A major villain, not a minor one)

== Cost ==
800 gold.
