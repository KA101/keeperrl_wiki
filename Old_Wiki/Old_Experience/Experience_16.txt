== Training ==
* Use wooden, iron and adamantium dummies to train in melee combat.
* Use wooden, iron and gold bookcases to train in magic combat.
* Use the archery targets to train ranged combat up to the creature's maximum level.

== Training efficiency ==
*Gold carpeting provides the best efficiency.
*Stone flooring is good efficiency and is not flammable.
*Wooden flooring is cheap and ugly and burns.
*Good lighting increases efficiency.
*Monsters are unable to train to the highest levels without the better dummies and bookcases.
*Archery targets require sufficient space to allow training.

== Killing an enemy ==
*Kill enemies to gain experience.
*Your minions, and Keeper, will gain a minimum of 0.02 experience for each creature killed.
*Enemies that are tougher than you will gain you extra experience for the kill, sometimes rather a lot
*Every 1.0 experience causes the creature to level up and will increase your combat abilities
*Combat experience acts independently of training experience and you can have both without decreasing the other
*Each creature has a maximum amount of training experience available and also a maximum amount of combat experience available
*Not all creatures can train or gain new combat experience
