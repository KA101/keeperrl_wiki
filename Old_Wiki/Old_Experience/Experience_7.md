== Training ==
* Use wooden, iron and adamantium dummies to train in melee combat
* Use wooden, iron and gold bookcases to train in magic combat
* Use the archery targets to train ranged combat up to the creatures maximum level

== Training efficiency ==
*Gold carpeting provides the best efficiency
*Stone flooring is good efficiency and is not flammable
*Wooden flooring is cheap and ugly and burns
*Good lighting increases efficiency
*Monsters are unable to train to the highest levels without the better dummies and bookcases.

== Killing an enemy ==
*Kill enemies to gain experience
*The tougher the monster you kill compared to you, the greater the experience is worth
