In KeeperRL the amount of resources you have is ''limited'': trees don't grow back, all ores are shown at the beginning on the map. There is a ''possibly'' a little exception with [[:Resources#Gold|gold]].

To gather resources you have to select them the ''Dig or cut tree'' tool. Your [[:Imp|Imps]] will then start to harvest the resource and carry it to your [[:Storage|stockpiles]].

== Wood ==
''You get wood by chopping down trees or bushes.''

The amount of wood planks per tile is: 
* per Tree : 25-40
* per Bush : 5-10

Wood is used to build [[:Category:Rooms|rooms]] (around 2/3 of them) and [[:Installations|installations]], like [[:Installations#Door|doors]], [[:Installations#Bridge|bridges]], etc. It's the first resource you are gonna need as it takes 20 wood per [[:Library|library]] tile, enabling [[:Technologies|research]].

Chopping down too many trees can summon a [[:Tree_Spirit|tree spirit]].

== Iron ==
''You get iron by mining ore veins.''

The amount of iron ore per tile is : 18 - 40

Iron is used to build [[:Category:Rooms|rooms]], usually with a military theme, such as the [[:Training Room|training room]], the [[:Manufactories#Forge|forge]], ect. Iron is quite common, you can usually get it in large amounts from the very beginning of the game.

== Granite ==
''You get granite by mining granite veins.''

The amount of granite per tile is : 18 - 40

Granite is used to build 2 [[:Category:Rooms|rooms]]: the [[:Graveyard|graveyard]] and the [[:Manufactories#Laboratory|laboratory]]. It is the rarest resource in the game, especially with an extensive graveyard.

== Gold ==
''You get gold by mining gold veins.&quot;&quot;

The amount of gold ore per tile is : 18 - 40

You need gold to pay your working creatures.

Hoarding to much gold will attract [[:Bandit|bandits]].

== Mana ==
''You get mana by ordering creatures to study in the [[:Library|library]]''

Every creature studying gives you : 0.2 mana every 1.0 - 2.5 ticks depending on the creatures speed.
