*French Versus
*Russian was requested by someone?
*&quot;Excuse me!&quot; when you walk past a monster. Should be less polite. (unless it's to the Keeper)


UI Improvements:

* Items in production could really benefit from a 100% meter over the progress bar
* Even better: The 100% and item being created could appear in the description text (the one that has the x and y coordinates)when you hover a workshop
* Remove construction IMHO should be right down cut&amp;dig, as making mistakes in positioning is really common and not worth 2 clicks.
* Message board needs a tooltip explaining how to use it (with a minion)

Constructions
* A new category &quot;Sleeping rooms&quot; could contain: beds, beast cages and graveyard (tombs)
