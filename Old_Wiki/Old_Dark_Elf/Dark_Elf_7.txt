== Summary ==

These weak fighters build deep multi-level dungeons where interesting creatures often dwell. At the bottom of their dungeons, you should expect to find a base where tougher warriors and the dark elf lord are found.

These creatures are notoriously cruel and can be recruited into your dungeon for a bit of gold where they can share in the pleasure of destroying humanity and other inferior animals.

Although they have blue skin they hate being called smurfs.
