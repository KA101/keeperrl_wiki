==Summary==
A powerful vampire who has no fear of sunlight, being surrounded by an aura of darkness. Not all vampires can fly but vampire lords invariably do. They can train a lot of levels in your dungeon and come with various spells. You find them in coffins in cemeteries and need some torture to persuade them to join you.
