Keepers are always warlocks (at the time of writing, in Alpha 21)

There have been some ideas for other characters. Please list them below:

==Alternative keeper characters==
*Existing warlock
*Military leader
*Deceiver (Political negotiator)
*Necromancer (Different spells)
*Shadow (Stealthy, subtle, fast)

Please feel free to contribute to this page (which needs your help).

Thanks
