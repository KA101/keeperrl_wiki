=Existing warlock=

This is the guy you get in Alpha 21. Let's keep him. :)

=Artificer (Artifice technology)=
Trinkets and toys for all the girls and boys! This character is Santa! Okay not really, he is genius bent on world domination.

==No recruitment. Build a golem army instead==

While the keeper recruits units when they volunteer, no units will join the Artificer this way (But he still has access to imps). Instead, he builds everything with his crafting skills at the workshop.

==Artifice Level 0==
*Build wooden golems.
*Wooden Golem: (Unarmed attacked bonus 10, can only wield one handed weapons, can't wield armor. Level 5. Cost: 100 wood. 
*Traits: Functional equivalent of undead. Courage. Poison Resistant. Workshop (50%). Speed: orc. Base Stats: Orc.
*Tasks: Crafting. 

==Artifice Level 1==
*Build Stone golems/Gargoyles 
*Traits: Traits: Functional equivalent of undead. Courage. Poison Resistant. Fire-resistant. Flying. Level 8.
*Tasks: Mana production (20%).
*Can't learn spells.
*Can wield two handed weapons, and armor.

*Other: Can build a stronger version of wooden golems. No crafting ability but has a higher level and Melee Trait (20%). Still can't wield two handed weapons.

==Artifice Level 2==
*Build iron golems. Level 10.
*Traits: Functional equivalent of undead. Courage. Poison Resistant. Fire-resistant. Slow. Weapon Melee (50%).
*Build Stone golem+: (Higher level, Melee skill)

==Artifice Level 3==
Iron Golem+

==Artifice Level 4==
* Build Robot Dragon. Can make an iron or steel version. Can only have one at a time.

==Bullet points==
*Race/Appearance: Clues to what they look like: Humanoid 
*Spells: Existing or new spells they could have: Does not have access to all the keeper's spells. Has healing. 
*Skills: What tasks an abilities are they capable of? Sorcery (20%). All crafting skills (Workshop, forge, etc at 100%). Mana production at 100%
*Tasks: What does he do off the battlefield and where does he do it? Crafting, Training, Eating, Studying. 
*Traits: Things that may influence combat or other gameplay. Initial Population Cap increased by 5. 
* Research: Geology research mana cost is half. Crafting, Jewelry, iron working unlocked from the start. 
*Diplomacy: First we admired him, then he built a throne! Humans, elves, like him. Keepers, dark factions hate him. Dragons don't hate him.
*Diplomacy: Are there any special commands on the tribes tab? No.

=Pyromancer (Offensive Specialist)=

Pyromancers are great at blowing things up, bad at studying. This character starts with healing spell, and firesphere. He/She can learn haste and strength, but no other spells from the usual spell tree. The first major difference between this character and the keeper is sorcery skill tree progression. The second major difference is this character cannot study to produce mana, and must rely on minions. As you progress through the skill tree, the sorcery skill increases.

Pyromancer skill tree is as follows

==Recruitment through immigration==

Very similar to existing warlock

==Starting spells==
Healing, Firesphere
(Sorcery 20%)

==Pyromancy level 1 (60 Mana) ==
Haste, strength,
Fire sphere 2
Fire blast 
(Sorcery 40%)

Fire sphere 2 is just another fire sphere spell with a separate cool down. 
Fireblast - Cooldown is medium. Same range as force bolt. Launches a ball of fire that does damage (Same as fire sphere)

== Pyromancy Level 2 (120 Mana)==
Firesphere Ring (Summons Three fire spheres at once, large cooldown) 
Summon Fire elemental (Cool down Medium)
Fire sphere 3
(Sorcery 60%)

== Pyromancy Level 3 (180 Mana) ==
Summon Fire elemental 2.
Summon Fire Wolves - summon's three hell wolves to attack all enemies. Act like the wolves in game except different sprite, causes flammable tiles to burn. (Cool down Large)
Fire Ring - Explosion around spell caster - like word of power except causes fire damage to enemies. 
Super Fireblast (Fireblast that shoots in a 3x4 tiles in front of spell caster, knocks enemies back)
Fire shield: Makes the caster immune to arrows temporarily (same cool down as magic shield)
(Sorcery 80%)

==Pyromancy Level 4 (360 Mana)==
Summon Fire elemental 3
Passive Buff - firespheres are blue. Negates enemy fire resistance. 
Form the phoenix - become a phoenix temporarily 100 turns. Speed buff, large unarmed attack buff, (Can't use weapons), Defense buff, flying. Trap immunity. Bolder immunity. Large cool down. Doesn't care about enemy fire resistance.
(Sorcery 100)

==Bullet points==
*Race/Appearance: Human. Red hair.
*Spells: See above.
*Skills: Only Sorcery. No studying. No mana production. No crafting. Can't wield a bow. Can't wield two handed weapons. (Need to have free hand for pyromancy)
*Tasks: Training, Eating, Sleeping. 
*Traits: Fire resistance. Stun resistance. 
*Diplomacy: Feared and hated. Pyromancy is outlawed by humans because of the destruction it causes. Pyromancers are so hated and feared all enemies are hostile, pyromancer can't have allies. 
*Diplomacy: Humans hate pyromancers. Forest critters (elves, tree spirit, hate them). All humanoids/lesser villians gain a new attack trigger when pyromancy level 2 is unlocked.

*Other Restrictions: Can't build a throne. The pyromancer does not wish to be king, just freedom from tyranny. Use the minion space wisely.
*Orc shamans can only learn up to pyromancy level 2. 

*Other Research:
Minion Fire immunity (200 or 400 mana)

=Rogue Knight (Military leader, Tank, front liner)=
A traitor who broke away from the human kingdoms, vowing revenge on those who dared cast doubt his way. Better base stats and iron starting equipment, poor at research and mana generation.

==Recruitment through immigration==

Very similar to existing warlock keeper.

==Visuals==
Culd look like one of the human knights, except maybe dressed in dark plate and with a full helm of some variety.

==Special combat moves==
*Optional feature

==Bullet points==
*Heal spell, Strength spell
*Skills: Melee 80%,
*Tasks: Training, Eating, Sleeping
*Traits: Humanoid
*Stats: Strength, Defense, Attack and Accuracy increasing with levels. Average dex.
*Diplomacy: &quot;This so-called knight must be made to pay for his crimes!&quot;
*Diplomacy: Human tribes have extra strong invasion triggers (He's a traitor)

=Deceiver (Political negotiator)=

==Recruitment through immigration==

Very similar to existing warlock keeper.

==Trick your enemy into stupidity on the tribes tab==

===Provocation===

Create an invasion trigger against your self.

===Peace Mongering===

Remove an invasion trigger.

===Dark persuasion===
Recruit from tribes that are not allied to you.

==Bullet points==
*Race - Dark elf
*No spells.
*Skills - Diplomatic manipulation (Able to heavily influence the triggers to invade you and when)
*Skills - Dark persuasion (Able to recruit from minor villains by using a large amount of mana and gold)
*Tasks - Eating, Sleeping, Studying
*Traits Humanoid
*Stats - Poor combat ability (Problems are solved through talking)
*With enough mana, she/he is able to manipulate who will attack you and when.
*Diplomacy - I thought we were friends!

=Shadow (Stealthy, subtle, fast)=

Overpower the innocent by stealth and do it anominously.

==Recruitment through immigration but powered down a bit==

Similar in most ways to existing warlock keeper.

==Reuses existing spells, traits, tasks and commands==

The main features for a shadow already exist in the game. It is a good choice for early development.

==Bullet points==
*Spells: Dexterity, Speed, Invisibility
*Stealth trait and night vision traits (Similar to werewolf)
*Disarming trait (similar to goblin)
*Crafting, Eating, Sleeping
*Hide command (similar to adventurers)
*Gaining levels increases dex and speed futher
*Archery 50%
*Diplomacy: &quot;Never heard of him!&quot;
*Diplomacy: Invasion triggers are delayed by quite a large number of turns
*Start at level 5

=Assassin (Stealthy, single target elimination)=

==Recruitment through immigration. Dungeon is less powerful==

The assassin's dungeon is less powerful. Perhaps traps are improved.

==Combat==
This character focuses on quick combat and single target elimination.

==Starting position==
Starting level 5, starts with stun, healing, escape, and invisibility spells. Also starts with stealth, disarm trap, archery, melee, sorcery, skills. Initial population limit is lowered by 5

==Assassin's dungeon==
*Mana production is at 70%.
*Throne only increases population by 5, and pigsty by 3.
*The population limit forces the player to rely on the keeper to do the majority of killing.

==Advancing levels==
This character levels up by combat/training twice as fast. This character rewards risky play by using the keeper as a main battle unit instead of hiding in the dungeon. The downside is that keeper is the most powerful unit, there are no second chances when you die. 

==Diplomacy==
Assassin's are wanted men, so all humanoid villains are more likely to trigger and attack your base (includes lesser villains). Kill or be killed!

==Bullet points==
*Assassin unit looks like Keeper except without the beard, and has a black cloak. Enemy assassins have a white cloak.
*Stun, healing, escape, invisibility spells.
*Skills: Stealth, disarm, archery 50%, melee 50%, sorcery 40%
*Tasks: Brewing, Eating, Sleeping, Training
*Traits: Humanoid
*Stats: Attack, accuracy, speed, dex.
*Diplomacy: &quot;Terrifying, none of us are safe!&quot; (Hated, but feared)
*Diplomacy: Invasion triggers could be stronger (hatred) but decrease with dungeon size (fear)

=Necromancer (Different spells)=

Necromancer - A completely new way to play the game.Necromancy was been suggested as its own magic school, but really should be its own class. 

==Recruitment by raising undead==
What would separate the necromancer from other classes is that he/she cannot recruit all minions like the keeper. Instead, he/she recruits minions by raising corpses. However, he/she can still have vampires join he/she normally.

==Starting kit and spells==
Healing Spell, Raise Corpse, Robe, Sword, 4 skeletons with the construction skill, 200 mana and basic sorcery. 

==Necromancy technology and spells==

The exclusive raise corpse spell is as follows 

Magic school: Necromancy
Special powers: Turns non-rotted, non-zombie corpse into a zombie. Turns a skeleton into an animated skeleton. The corpse type effects the minion added. For example, killing a human would reward a normal zombie when turned, but killing a dog would add a beast to the population. Different levels would have to be researched to raise the corpses/skeletons of bosses, legendary units, and other keepers. Will fail if population limit reached. Will fail if don't have a place to store corpse. (Like not having a bed for a unit)
Cooldown: 40 turns
Cost: 15 Mana per corpse, does not increase.
Concept: Grow an army of undead and rule both the realm of the living and dead!
Purpose in game: Allows the necromancer to grow his/her population. This is the only way they can recruit units, can't recruit minions like the Keeper.
Optional features: N/A
Discussion.

Under the necromancer, zombies would get a speed bonus and train faster to make them more viable as majority unit. 
Skeletons would also differ from zombies. They are less durable, faster, and have the construction and manufacturing skills. Stats would be slight better than the goblin and they would be able to equip items. Skeletons also wouldn't burn in sunlight.

==Existing technologies available==
The research tree would be the same as the keeper, except with a few additions and that basic sorcery would already be unlocked. First, the other levels of a necromancy can be researched. 

==Necromancy of higher villains==
Level 2 lowers the cool down of raise corpse, and allows one to raise multiple corpses at once. Also gives access to a necromantic blast spell. 
Level 3 Lets you raise lesser villains, smaller necromantic blast recharge.
Level 4 lets you raise main villains. 

==Other powerful spells==
Necromantic Blast
Cooldown: 100
Concept: Death spell for a death mage
Purpose: Gives an offensive class and offensive spell. Shoots a black bolt 3x3 tiles in front of avatar. Non piercing. Damage similar to a force bolt, but increases with each level of necromancy.

Secondly, the necromancer would have the darkness research trait/tree available to research. 
Level 1 -  Undead units resistant to sunlight. They won't burn but they lose one stat when in sunlight
Level 2 - Necromancer can create a large dark aura that protects units from sunlight. (Unlocks Spell, last for 200 turns, vampires can learn it)
Level 3 - Perpetual night. Cover the world in darkness (until death). Aggro's all lesser villains and main villains because they like the day. 

==Buildings==
Buildings only available to the necromancer:
Hole: Can dig a hole outside for a zombie to sleep in. Functionally identical to a grave except it can't attract vampires.


==Imps or skeletons?==
Discussion: Can have the necromancer use imps instead of skeletons, but it ruins the flavor.

==Bullet points==
Suggested bullet points (Added later by Keeperman):
*Race: Skeleton (hooded) (male). Female wears a black dress, black hair, light color eyes. 
*Spells: Healing, Raise corpse, Necromantic blast, Perpetual night
*Skills: Necromancy, Dark research
*Tasks: Training, Crafting, Studying
*Traits: Undead, Humanoid, Source of darkness
*Diplomacy: &quot;An evil that must be destroyed!&quot;
*Diplomacy: Good tribes have stronger invasion triggers. Evil villains like dragons are less concerned than normal.

=Elementalist (Different spells)=

==Uses the existing elementalist creature as a template==
*Good for re-using code.

Elementalist. Like the main villain in game. Aligned with knights and humans. Only uses mana to cast elementals, with each spell as a separate cool down. Spawns in a house, with a library and bed, a bit of gold, and first aid kits, and alchemy bench. Can't craft items. Gets mana by studying and some other source. Possibly using mana to spawn shard pilliars that regenerate mana over time. 

==No Training==
Elements are air, water, earth, fire. Elemental minions can't train to level up. 

==Level 1 (Fusion technology)==

Fuse two elementals to create a stronger elemental. For example, air and water is storm. Fire and Earth is iron. Air and fire is ice. Earth and water is slime. 

==Level 2 (Fusion)==
Fuse three elementals to create even stronger unit.

==level 3 (Fusion)==
Fuse the elements with yourself to become super powerful. Regrow limbs, gain 4 spells (Fireblast, wave, air bolt, earth quake)

==Other technologies==
*Sorcery technologies also available. 
*Basic Alchemy unlocked at start. 

==Dynamic world==
Enemies attack allies and you are called to defend them. For ex, dark elves verse elves.

==Bullet points==
*Race: Human
*Spells: Summon elemental, fire sphere, New elemental spells (See above)
*Skills: Elementalism
*Tasks: Brewery, Eating, Sleeping
*Traits: Humanoid, sorcery 100%
*Diplomacy: &quot;First we liked him, then he built a throne. Now he thinks he's king!&quot;
*Diplomacy: Can recruit from human tribes until war is declared.

=Flesh Weaver/Mad Scientist (Different rooms)=

Corpses gain a secondary value of worth (which changes to 0 when clean/only bones) with these you summon your units now.

==Imps are replaced by homoncul==
Created via mana and also will pick up corpses from outside. Aside from that, they would function as imps with the same mana progression cost.

Replacing the usual rooms of dormitories, beast cages, graveyards and ritual rooms would be the following rooms.

==Corpse Vats==
This is where you place corpses to store and create your new basic units. This is the first step and only costs 20 wood to make. each one also acts as the dormitory to hold your new creatures.

==Flesh farms==
This produces corpses(which could be fleshy might not be) for a renewable amount of enemies. this would cost 30 granite.

==Slurry pits==
This would be where you get your legendary abominations, your flesh golems, and oozing flesh creatures. once 6 or 7 bodies are inputted into it, then you will gain one legendary creature in return. (an alternative could be that major villain bodies have a quality and you need defeat those in order to get a legendary creature. make it that much harder and that much more damaging to lose on though as major villains are a finite resource.)

==Suggested bullet points==
(Added later by Keeperman):
*Race/Appearance: Frankenstein
*Spells: Share some spells with necromancer.
*Skills: Studying, Necromancy, Flesh weave
*Tasks: Training, Eating, Sleeping
*Traits: Humanoid
*Diplomacy: &quot;He must be stopped!&quot;
*Diplomacy: Good tribes will want to fight you. Evil and neutral villains will not be very interested.

=Mesmerist (Psychic powers)=

The mesmerist would rely on mental magics, but the main trick of a mesmerist is to be able to(at range) hypnotize and control enemy units.

NEW SPELLS:

==Hypnotism==
This will work on your common elf children and animals, but with that comes the plus of having a nice inexhaustible work force.(debatable if they would level up in your base or not, but it is possible.

==Dancing lights==
Need those pesky parents and other beings out of the way? this illusion would cause a set of two lights that go in the casted direction. all enemies must, and i repeat MUST follow this. once it ends the enemy of ocurse returns to you, but a bit of breath space is helpful.

==Mass Brainwash==
This is the true bread and butter to your mesmerist. This would be able to tame and grab those bandit hoards for you that come knocking at your door. of course you need beds for your new work force...but once you have them, you have them.

Lastly, I must say that hypnotizing hydras and dragons are a possibility but i leave it out of this as that would create quite an inbalance of power.

==Suggested bullet points==
(Added later by Keeperman):

*Race: Elf
*Spells: Sleep, Mass brainwash, Mind smash, Hypnosis, Dancing Lights
*Skills: Mind control, Sorcery
*Tasks: Eating, Studying
*Traits: No sleep, telepathy
*Diplomacy: Can sometimes &quot;Placate&quot; invasion triggers using mana from the Tribes tab
*Diplomacy: &quot;We ought to go to war against him, although I am feeling a bit...sleepy....&quot;

= Vampire Lord (Much like the exising minion)=

Be The Master of the Night.

==Other vampire Lords hostile or missing==
If you choose this form at the start of the game, you won't be able to find the Vampire lord minion in the graveyard, instead it will be a normal vampire. because YOU are the Vampire lord!.

==You start the game at night==
Best feelings.

==Good reuse of existing features==

Similar in most ways to the Vampire lord minion.

==Bullet points==

*Race/Appearance: &quot;Human&quot; Vampire, Stylish Cape
*Spells: Hypnotise, Bat form, Mist form, Blood Magic
*Skills: Combat Bite, Unnatural speed/Strength, Night Vision, Unnatural hearing (can see invisible enemies) 
*Tasks: Studying, Training, Sleeping, Feeding, (on Prisoner &quot;Cattle&quot; Perhaps?) Torture
*Traits: Humanoid, Terrifying

*Features: Easier to get Vampire and demon Minions with graveyards and Ritual rooms have Vampire themed Dungeon objects, instead of grave stones have them be Coffins for vampires, a new Vamp themed throne, Tall Candelabras instead of torches etc.
