== Summary ==
It is somebody employed to follow knights and human archers to heal them. As if they weren't already bad enough.

These guys can also be found in temples which appear randomly in forests. They can be quite tough in terms of spell damage and could be worth taking alive.

White Knights are able to recruit and train priests, which are somewhat weaker than the default ones.
