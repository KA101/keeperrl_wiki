==Summary==

These are the worst of the elven archers and often carry artifact bows capable of shooting down serious warriors. Care is needed when approaching an elf lord, to avoid getting arrows stuck in your head. Really makes a nice addition to your dungeon if converted but it won't be easy. As with most humanoids, sometimes he goes to bed, so a stealth attack at night might be a good strategy.
