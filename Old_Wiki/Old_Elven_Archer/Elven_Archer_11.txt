== Summary ==
You are walking through the woods and suddenly an arrow goes through your forehead and that is the last thing you that you ever experience. It was probably an elven archer.

== Strategy ==
Ideally, get something that can shoot back at them. A flying archer, such as a harpy that can see the over the trees. Burn the trees down if you need to because they have special vision inside a forest and it gives them an advantage.

These archers can be converted by keepers and are excellent at shooting down Adamantium golems. They see through trees and shoot accurately past them when used during daylight hours.
