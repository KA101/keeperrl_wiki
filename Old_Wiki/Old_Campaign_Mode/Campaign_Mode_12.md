==Single Maps==
*You can play single map games, with all enemies on the same map sector
*Single maps are bigger than ordinary map sectors in a campaign
*Single map dungeons cannot be retired and uploaded for others to fight against
*Single map games are for Keepers only.
*You can compete for the hi-score

=Campaign Maps=
*Campaigns are very similar to single map games but you have a master map containing other enemies and allies on various map sectors.
*Keeper dungeons are controlled by AI
*You can press 't' to travel between map sectors while controlling one of your creatures.
*You can compete for the official hi-score
*You can upload your dungeon to be challenged in free-play games
*You can customise campaigns
*You can get to play against up to 4 hand-crafted dungeons designed by real people. (If you like you can usually choose ones which have never ever been played against previously - by anyone!).
*You get to choose the number of enemies (within a range)
*Waves of extra enemies can be set to invade from the beginning or after you win (or not at all)
*You can upload your dungeon if you win
