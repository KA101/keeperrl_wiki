==Single Maps==
*You can play single map games, with all enemies on the same map sector
*Single maps are bigger than ordinary map sectors in a campaign
*Single map dungeons cannot be retired and uploaded for others to fight against
*Single map games are for Keepers only.

==Campaign Maps==
*Campaigns are very similar to single map games but you have a master map containing other enemies and allies on various map sectors.
*You select how many enemies and which other players to fight against. Other player's dungeons are controlled by AI and you can upload your own one if you win.
*You can press 't' to travel between map sectors while controlling one of your creatures.
