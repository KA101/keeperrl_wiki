==Single Maps==
*You can play single map games, with all enemies on the same map sector
*Single maps are bigger than ordinary map sectors in a campaign
*Single map dungeons cannot be retired and uploaded for others to fight against
*Single map games are for Keepers only.

=Campaign Maps=
*Campaigns are very similar to single map games but you have a master map containing other enemies and allies on various map sectors.
*Keeper dungeons are controlled by AI
*You can press 't' to travel between map sectors while controlling one of your creatures.
*You can compete for the official hi-score
*You can upload your dungeon to be challenged in free-play games

==Free-play mode==
*These are custom campaigns
*You can get to play against up to 4 hand-crafted dungeons designed by real people. (If you like you can usually choose ones which have never ever been played against previously - by anyone!).
*You get to choose your starting location
*You get to choose the number of enemies (within a range)
*You can play &quot;generate mana in library&quot; where you can research technologies just by studying
*You can still upload your dungeon if you win

==Basic Strategies==
Keepers will find this walkthrough helpful:
* [[Quick Start Walkthrough]]

When at war with another dungeon, many of the tips in the adventurer guide are helpful for keepers:
