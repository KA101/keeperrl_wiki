KeeperRL Alpha 31 is out!
KeeperRL Alpha 31 is released! The two major features brought by this update are the new Warlord game mode and moddable randomly generated maps. Check out the rundown below to get an idea about all the rest of the new stuff.

I‚Äôd like to thank everyone involved in crash testing this patch, sending bug reports and suggestions. Your help was invaluable!

As always, the update is already available on Steam, Itch.io, and Humble Store. You can also get the free version from here.

 PLAYERS SAID

There are no other games out there like KeeperRL. The game is a unique mixture of management, levelling, crafting, constructing, exploring, adventure etc. [‚Ä¶] The possibility of interacting with other‚Äôs players monumental dungeons turn KeeperRL into one of the most promising games I‚Äôve found.

This game is amazing! It‚Äôs challenging, fun, unique, and exactly what you might expect it to be. For an early access game it‚Äôs incredible. And the thought that there‚Äôs more to come thrills me! I can‚Äôt wait to see how this awesome game will develop even more.

Any time I touch another race, I get bent over like a cheap, overworked sex worker. I love sucking at this game so much.
