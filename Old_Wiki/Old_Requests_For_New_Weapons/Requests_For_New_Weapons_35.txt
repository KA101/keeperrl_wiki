=== Iron Spear ===
*Damage: 4 - 8
*Accuracy = 6
*Attack type: Pierce
*Weight: 5
*Price: 70
*Type: Two Handed
* Concept: Less damage than a sword but higher accuracy (They are nice and long).
* Purpose in game: An alternative to swords, to add variety.
* Optional features: Big thrown bonus. Throwing spears could really do damage.
* Discussion: This could be interesting with a range of two. Kind of like reach.
** Should come in more material variants: wooden spear, steel spear, maybe silver spear?
** I really like the idea of reach for spears. Maybe they couldn't be equipped at the same time as bows and Alt+dir would instead make you reach with the spear? --[[User:Red kangaroo|Red kangaroo]] ([[User talk:Red kangaroo|talk]]) 17:01, 27 February 2017 (CET)
** That could be really interesting. (Keeperman)
** Does it need to be equipped before it can be thrown?
** Not sure what AI would do with spears. It would be great if they could throw it, but then fetching is complicated.
** Perhaps not throwing but having extended reach is an option, but that's complex to implement

= Ranged Weapons =

== Normal ==

Ranged weapons deal &quot;normal&quot; damage at distance. They are wielded by normal humanoid infantry units (orcs, harpies).  Some creatures are not capable of wielding ranged weapons (they have the no ranged weapon trait).

*Concept: Low amounts of ranged blunt damage
*Purpose in game: Existing ranged projectiles (arrows) do pierce damage

*Price: 1 iron (x 20)

* Purpose in game: Ranged damage with large burst
* Optional features: Different types of bolts (fire, poison, etc); Heavy version that cannot be used by weak creatures

== Magic ==

Magic weapons include wands, staves, sceptres, orbs and the like.  They provide spellcasters such as orc shamans, vampires, and the keeper with a way to deal damage or otherwise affect the world at a distance.

* I like the idea of wands and such, but they really should have somehow limited use, or they will easily outclass any other possible weapon. I don't think increasing the cost of creation is the best way to go. What if, instead:
** Using wands had a cooldown just as spells, and affected by Sorcery - creatures without Sorcery would need to wait forever to shoot again, but shamans and such could use them semi-regularly.
** Wands were created with only a handful of charges, just like healing kits. This would actually be in line with the implementation in many other roguelikes and would probably work quite okay.

*Weight: Low
*Price: 5000 mana

*Purpose in game: Expensive ranged weapon that uses magic and doesn't need ammo. Fire immune creatures are not hurt at all.
*Optional features: Random chance of this weapon breaking when you use it.

*Discussion: The price is way too high, IMHO. Random breakage can also result in pretty stupid situations. See above for other ways of limiting the uses.

== Rods ==
Rods would be a type of magic weapons that, unlike ranged wands, are used in melee. You would equip them and hit enemies with them just as if they were a normal club, but on hit, they would proc with a special effect.

=== Rod of Flame ===
*Damage: medium to high
*Accuracy: good
*Attack type: fire
*Weight: medium to high
*Price: ???
*Type: melee
*Concept: Melee weapon dealing pure fire damage instead of physical.
