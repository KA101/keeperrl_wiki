==Summary==

Raging storms that blast nearby enemies, not normally those occurring naturally but instead spiritually summoned using the magic of either heroic elementalists or the dark powers of dungeon keepers. They are restricted by their summoner's authority and are forced to depart this world again if their summoner is killed. They also tire and must then be summoned again if they are to remain active.
