Note: The cost of technologies should probably be such that you will rarely be able to get them all in a single game. Perhaps just one or two of the really powerful ones.

=Unlock new immigration=

==Elite Greenskins==

==Elite Undead==
*Unlocks extra undead buffs and removes the nerfs from appearing in the immigration queue

==Animal Magic==
*Unlocks more powerful versions of bears and wolves. Also allows recruiting poisonous spiders and snakes

==Demonic alliance==
*Get ancient spirits and some of the other demons

==Undead hoards==
*Recruit packs of undead that take up only one population slot (like wolf packs).

==Marriage of convenience==
*Marry into royalty and get a powerful spouse to help you win the game
*Choose between a male or female spouse and disable the other spouse once you have one

=Unlock new spells=

==Elite Sorcery==
*Benefit: Unlocks a new set of super advanced spells (See the suggested spells)
*Discussion: http://keeperrl.com/wiki/index.php?title=Requests_for_new_spells#Elite_sorcery_.28new_tech.29

==Basic/Advanced/Master Necromancy==
*Benefit: Progressively buff a new necromancy spell school.

=Dungeon boosts=

==Overlord==
*Benefit: Evil Eye can see farther/invisible units and night vision, Keeper Gains Permanent Stat buff of +2 to all base stats, Increase Pop cap by 10. Gain 5 Free Imps.
*Discussion: Too generous? Increase cost or reduce benefits.

==Salaries==
*Benefit: Population cap maxed out at 100 but minions need paying every day. If you run out of gold they refuse to do any tasks.
*Discussion: Some players liked the old salary system. Perhaps make them happy :)

(Freeasabird)- Set this as an option in the menus. I sure as hell don't wan't this back. i LIKE large minion pools. they shouldn't want payment, they should be loyal to your power as an evil dark lord.

==Stone laying (Achievable by changing configuration files in Alpha 26 onwards)==
*Benefit: Filling in dungeon tiles no longer costs stone. Make that wonder dungeon you always wanted to make without worrying about running out.

Discussion: -Freeasabird- I would think it would be more balanced if This tech advance would reduce the amount of stone used per tile. instead of 10 stone per tile it would be 5 or 3 stone per tile, more efficient use of stone.

==Debris Management==
*Benefit: Grant resource +20 stone for every 100 tiles mined by imps. Stone is left in a pile on dungeon floor for collection.

==Economics (Implemented as alchemical conversion from Alpha 25 onwards)==
*Benefit: Unlock trading. Buy and sell other resources from gold. Must find an ally to trade with first.

==Recycling==
*Benefit: Convert your unwanted weapons and armour back into resources (50% of what they were created from)

==Resurrection==
*Benefit: Give your keeper another chance, one extra life

=Minion Buffs=

==Regrow body parts (Config change to unlock potions that regrow body parts possible from Alpha 26 onwards)==
*New legs for everyone! Give your crippled units back a leg so they can walk instead of crawl.

==Military discipline==
*Benefit: Make your minions braver in battle

==Tyranny==
*Benefit: Imps work faster

==Guilds==
*Benefit: Give creatures xp for doing their studying and crafting tasks (Levels earned by studying and crafting could be 2 or 3 max)

==Hideous strength surge==
*Benefit: All existing minions get an immediate +3 _Strength_ boost - permanent but one off, use wisely

==Unnatural dexterity surge==
*Benefit: All existing minions get an immediate +3 _Dexterity_ boost - permanent but one off, use wisely

==Evil growth surge==
*Benefit: All existing minions get an immediate full recovery of limbs - one off, use wisely

==Keeper mutation==
*Benefit: Change his sprite and increase his dexterity and strength permanently
*Would have to just upgrade his other stats and skills maybe give him new abilities, due to the latest update

==Combat Succubus (Expected to be achievable in Alpha 27 onwards by changing the config files)==
*Benefit: Succubus gains ability to use equipment and to train in the training rooms. (Needs to be doing rituals to give birth to legends).
*Optional features: Gains one or more spells.
*Alternatives: All of this without having to pay for the technology.
*References: http://keeperrl.com/forums/topic/combat-succubi/

==Fertility (Achievable by editing the configs in Alpha 26 onwards)==
*Succubus gets the ability to give birth to one extra legend.

==Regrow trees==
*Tree stumps turn into fully grown trees (or perhaps a % of tree stumps do). Plus burnt trees.

==Basic energies==
*Benefit: Reduces spell cool down by 10% on all minions

==Regrow limbs==
*Put the arms and legs back on your minions

==Advanced energies==
*Benefit: Reduces spell cool down by 20% on all minions. Replaces basic energies

==Master energies==
*Benefit: Reduces spell cool down by 30% on all minions. Replaces advanced energies

=Minion Behaviours=

==Call to arms==
*Benefit: Idle Minions automatically craft their own items and pay for it from their own pocket. However, this production is very slow.
*Discussion: Some people prefer this style of play to the production queues.

==Tactics (Military Tactics or tactical training?)==
*Benefit: Combat capable minions have extra tactical options depending on the minion type. (guarding, patrolling, long range only, certain spells only, etc.)
*Optional features: Multiple tiers: basic, advanced, etc.
*Alternatives: tactics available based on level of minion on an individual basis.

==Self Preservation==
*Benefit: Imps will cancel their current task and fall back inside the dungeon during attacks. Afterwards, they resume their previous task.

==Adventurers (Can be done by changing config file in Alpha 26 onwards)==
*Benefit: Get access to the adventurer class as a minion.
*Adventurers do not train or learn magic, but can level up from level 5 to level 20 by fighting real enemies in combat. Great rogue-like unit.

=Building Unlocks=

==Settlements (Campaign mode only)==
*Benefit: Plant a settlement on a different map tile in the world map.
*Discussion: Some players have asked for this, but I heard it is technically difficult

==Camps (Implemented in Alpha 26 without the need to research anything)==
*Cost: 10000 mana
*Benefit: Build walls Wood/Stone/Iron/Steel outside your dungeon in the hills and woods beyond.

=Diplomacy=

You are the the Evil Overlord of Devilish minions. No Humanoid Tribe would Deal with you without the point of a blade at your throat. Diplomacy with minor allies (of the keeper) on the other hand should be a thing.
