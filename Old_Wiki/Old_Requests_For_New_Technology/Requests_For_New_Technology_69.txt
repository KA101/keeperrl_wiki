Note: The cost of technologies should probably be such that you will rarely be able to get them all in a single game. Perhaps just one or two of the really powerful ones.

*Discussion: Some players liked the old salary system. Perhaps make them happy :)

(Freeasabird)- Set this as an option in the menus. I sure as hell don't wan't this back. i LIKE large minion pools. they shouldn't want payment, they should be loyal to your power as an evil dark lord.

==Stone laying (Achievable by changing configuration files in Alpha 26 onwards)==
*Benefit: Filling in dungeon tiles no longer costs stone. Make that wonder dungeon you always wanted to make without worrying about running out.

Discussion: -Freeasabird- I would think it would be more balanced if This tech advance would reduce the amount of stone used per tile. instead of 10 stone per tile it would be 5 or 3 stone per tile, more efficient use of stone.

*Benefit: Combat capable minions have extra tactical options depending on the minion type. (guarding, patrolling, long range only, certain spells only, etc.)
*Optional features: Multiple tiers: basic, advanced, etc.
*Alternatives: tactics available based on level of minion on an individual basis.

==Self Preservation==
*Benefit: Imps will cancel their current task and fall back inside the dungeon during attacks. Afterwards, they resume their previous task.
