Note: The cost of technologies should probably be such that you will rarely be able to get them all in a single game. Perhaps just one or two of the really powerful ones.

(Freeasabird)- Set this as an option in the menus. I sure as hell don't wan't this back. i LIKE large minion pools. they shouldn't want payment, they should be loyal to your power as an evil dark lord.

==Stone laying==
*Cost: 1000 mana
*Benefit: Filling in dungeon tiles no longer costs stone. Make that wonder dungeon you always wanted to make without worrying about running out.

Discussion: -Freeasabird- I would think it would be more balanced if This tech advance would reduce the amount of stone used per tile. instead of 10 stone per tile it would be 5 or 3 stone per tile, more efficient use of stone.
