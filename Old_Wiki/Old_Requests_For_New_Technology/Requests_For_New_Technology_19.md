==Tyranny==
*Cost: 500 mana
*Benefit: Imps get +20 speed to work faster

==Guilds==
*Cost: 700 mana
*Benefit: Give creatures xp for doing their studying and crafting tasks (Levels earnt by studying and crafting could be 2 or 3 max)

==Stone laying==
*Cost: 1000 mana
*Benefit: Filling in dungeon tiles no longer costs stone. Make that wonder dungeon you always wanted to make without worrying about running out.

==Call to arms==
*Cost: 1000 mana
*Benefit: Idle Minions automatically craft their own items and pay for it from their own pocket. However, this production is very slow.
*Discussion: Some people prefer this style of play to the production queues.

==Debris Management==
*Cost: 2000 mana
*Benefit: Grant resource +20 stone for every 100 tiles mined by imps. Stone is left in a pile on dungeon floor for collection.

==Salaries==
*Cost: 5000 mana
*Benefit: Population cap maxed out at 100 but minions need paying every day. If you run out of gold they refuse to do any tasks.
*Discussion: Some players liked the old salary system. Perhaps make them happy :)

==Settlements (Campaign mode only)==
*Cost: 5000 mana
*Benefit: Plant a settlement on a different map tile in the world map.
*Discussion: Some players have asked for this, but I heard it is technically difficult

==Provocation==
*Cost: 1000 mana
*Benefit: Give every hostile tribe on the map a new attack trigger

==Slave Labour==
*Cost: 500 mana
*Benefit: Make prisoners craft things for you (unlock a crafting task)

==Adventurers==
*Cost: 1000 mana
*Benefit: Get access to the adventurer class as a minion.
*Adventurers do not train or learn magic, but can level up from level 3 to level 40 by fighting real enemies in combat. Great rogue-like unit.

==Economics==
*Cost: 1500 mana
*Benefit: Unlock trading. Buy and sell other resources from gold. Must find an ally to trade with first.
