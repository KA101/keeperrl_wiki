=Download instructions=
Alpha 26 has introduced new modding support. Download the zip files and copy them to your &quot;KeeperRL\data_free&quot; folder. To apply a mod, unzip it to &quot;data_free&quot; folder and replace any existing mod files that are already there. Restart KeeperRL for good measure. Leave the zip files in that &quot;data_free&quot;, so you can switch to any desired mod whenever you want to, just by extracting the zip file.

Enjoy!
