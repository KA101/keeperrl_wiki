== Mushroom Farm ==

* Cost per tile: 10 mana
* Attracts minions: None
* Production queue: None (Or perhaps you could choose production of different mushrooms)
* Minion tasks: Eating
* Technology: Mushroom farming
* Spawning: Mushrooms (not pigs)
* Spawn rate: Slow
* Special effects: +1 population* 
* Concept: What is the basic concept behind this?
* Purpose in game: What makes this thing unique?
* Optional features: Minions could go there to eat mushrooms and get the effects of those mushrooms by eating them.
* Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

== Medical Room ==
* Cost per tile: 15 iron and/or Stone
* Attracts minions: None, can be worked by Orc shamans only.
* Production queue: A better more fitting place to create Medkits.
* Production queue: Attachable arm, attachable leg etc. Costings lost limbs (eg. orc arm etc.)
* Minion tasks: Surgery (Add to orc shaman)
* Technology: Medicine (New technology costing lots of mana)
* Spawning: Medkits (Instead of workshop).
* Spawning: Attachable limbs.
* Spawn rate: Depends on how many Orc Shamans are manning the room. Same as existing workshop for Medkits.
* Special effects: Minions that are wounded or have lost limbs can get attachable limbs here (if the limb is an arm and is reattached to an orc that lost an arm and is still fresh and not completely rotted, this would take some time)
* Special effects and/or magically regrow limbs for a small sum of mana say 100 per limb.
* Concept: Instead of just disarming them and then drowning them just send them here and NOT lose your lvl 56 Vampire lord. &gt;:[
* Purpose in game: Minions that lose limbs become all but useless. Now you can have them back in your army.
* Optional features: Make Medkits, Reattach limbs for time and mana.
* Discussion: Keeperman 22/02/2017. Rearranged the wording to clarify. Tried to keep the whole idea the way it was intended.

== Market ==
* Cost per tile: 30 gold
* Attracts minions: None.
* Production queue: Convert resources to gold and gold to other resources.
* Minion tasks: Trading
* Technology: Currency
* Spawning: Resources or gold
* Spawn rate: Increases with more minions
* Special effects: Trading, which is kind of missing at the moment
* Purpose in game: Juggle resources at a small cost
* Optional features: Could be done without minions and without a new trading task or currency technology
* Similar features: Similar to the way that a steel furnace can turn iron into steel. The market could do the same for iron into gold and gold into stone etc.

==Slave Market==
*Room: Slave Market
*Cost per tile: 40 gold
*Attracts minions: Slavedriver = An orc warrior with an extra minion task (slavetrading)
*Production Queue: 50 gold for each prisoner sold
*Minion tasks: Slavetrading (Brings prisoners out of the prison and auctions them in the market on a production queue)
*Technology: Trading
*Spawning: Slavedriver (see requests for new minions)
*Spawn rate: Slow
*Special Effects: Some kingdoms would like to buy their prisoners back for gold. They can also offer not to attack you for 2 prisoners etc.
*Purpose in game: Money. Balance amount of gold per prisoner with speed of production queue.
*Optional Features: Jack up the prices (if they ever want to see their loved ones again). Higher price slaves increase the production time but give you more gold. Have a few different price options on the production queue.

== New room (Requested) ==
* Cost per tile: How much of which resource?
* Attracts minions: ?
* Production queue: What does it produce?
* Minion tasks: What minions are needed and what tasks must they have to work the queue?
* Technology: What new technology unlocks this?
* Spawning: Specific items created
* Spawn rate: Fast or slow? How can you speed it up?
* Special effects: Neat features...
* Purpose in game: How does it add to the game?
* Optional features: What would make it even better?
