== Medical Room ==
* Cost per tile: 15 iron and/or Stone
* Attracts minions: None, can be worked by Orc shamans only.
* Production queue: a better more fitting place to create Medkits.
* Minion tasks: Surgery
* Technology: Medical
* Spawning: medkits
* Spawn rate: Depends on how many Orc Shamans are manning the room.
* Special effects: Minions that are wounded or have lost limbs can come here to get healed and have their limbs reattached (if the limb is an Orc arm and is reattached to an orc that lost an arm and is still fresh and not completely rotted, This would take some time, but will be Free) or magically regrow the limb for a small sum of mana say 100 per limb.
* Concept: Minions that lose limbs become all but useless. instead of just un arming them and then drowning them just send them hear and NOT lose your lvl 56 Vampire lord. &gt;:[
* Purpose in game: See above ^
* Optional features: Make Medkits, Reattach limbs for time and mana. thats about it really.
