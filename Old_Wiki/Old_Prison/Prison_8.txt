It is possible to build separate prisons and torture rooms but I tend to build them together for convenience.

==Prison cells==
To acquire prisoners, right click on humanoid enemies when fighting in a team and select &quot;Order Capture&quot;. Make sure you have enough space in your prison for your prisoners (the first 4 prisoners are &quot;free&quot; but after that you need prison tiles). See the [Prisoner Guide] for details.
*15 iron cost per prison tile

==Torture tables==
*The Torture tables are where you torture your prisoners, and may be able to convert them. The survival rate is about 50%.
*20 iron cost
