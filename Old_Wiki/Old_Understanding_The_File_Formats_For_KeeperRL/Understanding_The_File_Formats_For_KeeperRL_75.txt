*Lines starting in a # are ignored and may contain useful comments

=technology.txt=
*Locate technology.txt on your computer. It should look like this: 
[https://github.com/miki151/keeperrl/blob/master/data_free/game_config/vanilla/technology.txt Technology.txt]

*There are 4 sub-sections below each section. These subsections are respectively for:
#Workshop
#Forge
#Lab
#Jeweller
*Each subsection has as many entries as you want.

Example of an empty section with all 4 subsections but no actual entries:
 &quot;DwarvenCrafting&quot;
 # Workshop
 {
 }
 
 # Forge
 {
 }
 
 # Lab
 {

 # Jeweller
 
 {
 }

===Entries===
*Each entry enables an item to be built in that workshop, forge, jewellers or lab.
*The entry has two possible formats
1) {{[[ItemTypes|ItemType]]} '''BuildSpeed''' [[ResourceIDs|ResourceID]] '''Amount'''}

Example:
 {{LeatherGloves} 1 WOOD 2}

2) {{[[ItemTypes|ItemType]]} '''BuildSpeed''' [[ResourceIDs|ResourceID]] '''Amount''' &quot;'''TechID'''&quot;}

Example:
 {{HeavyClub} 5 WOOD 20 &quot;two-handed weapons&quot;}

...so, the tech Id for two handed weapons is a requirement before you can craft heavy clubs.
