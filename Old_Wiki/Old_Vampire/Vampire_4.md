== Summary ==
A good early game spell caster with complimentary combat skills. They are useful inside your dungeon against invaders, especially knights and golems that have a resistance to melee attacks but can be hurt using magic. They are not recommended to travel far with since they crumble to dust in sunlight and it isn't pretty.

When facing these in enemy dungeons, can be damaged using silver swords and sometimes tempted out into an open battlefield where they forget the time and can meet the sunrise.
