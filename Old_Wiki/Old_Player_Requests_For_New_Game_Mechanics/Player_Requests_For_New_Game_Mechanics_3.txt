== Guard Duty ==
How about putting minions like orcs and ogres or any combat minion on guard duty.
The minion stands their and attacks when within a given range.
The minion can still sleep/eat but guard duty overrides other jobs.

== Wandering Enemies ==
Not so much as a request for new villains, but for more wandering enemies to attack your lair/keep. Currently, if I stay in my keep and not attack, I can build up to tier 3 dummies and have my minions almost maxxed without being attacked once. I usually reach that point around turn 17000. I'm thinking that wandering enemies attacking around every 1000 turns and have their level/difficulty increase like every 2000 turns. You can use an uploaded player's adventurers as a wandering enemy. Just a thought.
