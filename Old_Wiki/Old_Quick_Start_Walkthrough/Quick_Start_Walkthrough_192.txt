Keepers are evil tyrants who commit war crimes. If you want to be a hero, try playing an adventurer.
* Choose your role. Choose &quot;keeper&quot; to begin with.

A new campaign map showing map sectors will be displayed. It may look something like this one:

[[File:CampaignMap-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 CampaignMap-Screenshot.png

You can experiment with the game set up. When you click confirm a map is generated for you and you will now be launched into the overhead view.  Here you can start building your dungeon.

== Victory Objective ==

Claim victory by conquering all the local tribes.
Next, finalise your defences and upload your map, so that adventurers and keepers belonging to other players can then invade it.

== Starting position ==

The maps are random. You start with your [[keeper]] and 4 minion [[imp]]s. The screen may look like this:

[[File:StartingPosition-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 StartingPosition-Screenshot.png

You will occasionally see text in orange. These hints will provide you with ideas on what to do next. When playing the tutorial, there are step-by-step instructions at the bottom of the screen. Campaigns have a campaign map, which contain other smaller map sectors and appears before you start the game. The main villains and allies will be found on this master map. View this during the game, using the compass icon.

== Game options ==

Press escape to view the game options. Save the game, abandon it or retire (after winning). Change graphics and sound etc.

[[File:GameOptions-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 GameOptions-Screenshot.png

You can also pause the game at any time by pressing space. This will give you time to think and issue complex orders. If it looks like you are winning, you can increase the game speed to fast-forward it (until you are invaded).

[[File:GameSpeed-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]

== Tabs ==

The four menu tabs in the top left corner of the screen are as follows:

* Construction (pickaxe icon)
* Minions (horned face icon)
* Research (book icon)
* Help (question mark icon)

[[File:Tabs-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 Tabs-Screenshot.png

Below the mini map in the top right are two buttons
* Campaign Map (compass icon)
* Find keeper (keeper icon)
* You can also click on the mini map to see expand it.

[[File:MiniMapExpanded-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]

== Resources and game information ==

Along the bottom are your resource stats:

* Gold
  Gained by looting enemies.
  Gained by creating a treasure room and asking imps to mine out the yellow gold tiles. 

* Wood
  Gained by creating a resource stockpile and asking your imps to cut trees.
 
* Iron
  Gained by creating a resource stockpile and asking imps to mine out the iron tiles.

* Adamantium
  Gained by assaulting adamantium golems and mining their ore.
  
* Stone
  Gained by creating a resource stockpile and asking imps to mine out the white stone tiles.

[[File:ResourcePanel-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 ResourcePanel-Screenshot.png

These [[resources]] are what is needed to build things in the dungeon. Under the resource stats you can also see your dungeon level, population limit, which turn you are in, and also how much daylight or night is remaining. Day and night have an impact on strategy, since only some creatures can see in the dark, while there are also some creatures that quickly die in sunlight.

Advanced players may loot enemy dungeons by controlling an imp and carrying resources back to base. (Imps can carry endless items in their magic pockets because they have no maximum weight limit). When an enemy is entirely defeated, you can select the tribes strip and use the pillage option to loot the enemy instead. Later in the game and depending on your level of arrogance, insensitivity and violence, many hostile forces start to get worried about you.

== Building Rooms and Gathering Resources ==

Create storage rooms by clicking the &quot;Storage&quot; icon under the orders menu, then mark out the space. The floor will change colour. You normally want both resource and equipment storage. There is currently no limit to the amount you can store on one tile, so you can design it how you like. You can also store resources outside the dungeon. 

Now that you have a storage space allocated, you can have the imps start cutting down trees. Use the &quot;Dig or cut tree&quot; option, dig out the mountain, and also mark trees. Do some mining. Rocks inside the mountain will be visible. A treasure chest will give you somewhere to store the gold, but be careful, bandits will scry your wealth, so it is normally a good idea not to mine gold until you are ready for a small fight.

== Building Your First Dungeon ==

The main benefit of playing a keeper is that you can build a dungeon. Adventurers can only invade dungeons.

The first thing to do is simply start digging!  On the top left are the various action icons. The pickaxe icon (the leftmost one) lets you give orders to your imps. The top menu is called &quot;Structure&quot;. Under the structure menu select &quot;Dig or cut tree&quot;. Select that one and have the imps start digging.

You can be as creative as you want when it comes to designing the layout of your dungeon. The imps dig fairly quickly if they are not mining ores; stick to the plain black area and they can dig large [[:Category:Rooms|rooms]] in a short time.  You can hold down shift with the mouse and draw out rectangles, too. Hold down the CTRL key and drag to cancel blocks of orders shown on the map.

== Library, workshop, training dummies, beds and cages ==

The next thing you probably want to build is a library. The library is important because the shaman, vampires and other spell casters need to research spells there. Have the imps dig out a room, usually at least 10x20 but it can be bigger. Make sure you have some wood stockpiled as well.

Then simply build your library in that space from the orders menu. The bookshelves will get in your way, so place them one-by-one at suitable locations. The [[keeper]] will usually immediately move to the library and spend most of the time there. Dot some torches around the library walls and consider laying down some crude flooring. It will speed up spell research. Watch out for using too many wooden floors, because later on in the game, they may get set alight. Once the library is built spell casting  minions can start researching spells.

Next build a few wooden training dummies in a different room and after that a few workshop stands. Have a room for beds and a room for cages.

== Early recruitment ==

Recruit a small team of minions and let them train, study and craft some wooden items. Orc shaman are good healers. Other orcs are the best starter units for fighting. Most of your first recruits should be orcs and orc shaman. Goblins are the best early game crafting minion. A few beasts will help you explore the map. Bats can explore at night. Ravens and bats can fly and have a the best line-of-sight. Ravens are the fastest. Cave bears are reasonable at the start of the game for exploring caves and doing some easy combat. Packs of wolves help manage prison population later on, but can be useful as combat units at the start because a pack of wolves use only one population slot.

== Construction ==

Various [[constructions]] are possible. Construct items by clicking on the pickaxe icon. Select squares for your [[imp]]s to dig and cut. Assign dungeon squares for storage of [[resources]] and items. Build treasure rooms, dormitories, training rooms, libraries, workshops, forges, laboratories, jewellers, ritual rooms, beast lairs, graveyards, prisons and torture chambers. The selected construction will highlight in green. Click on map squares to give the orders.

== Orders ==

Use the orders menu from the construction tab to claim tiles, fetch items, prioritise tasks and remove construction. The selected option will highlight in green. Click on the map squares to issue the orders. You can set up forbidden zones and this is the best way to stop your creatures angering nearby inhabitants or to keep them locked in a room out of trouble.

It is possible to reinforce walls and block in tunnels, although it is generally a bad idea to cut yourself off from the outside world completely (If invaders can't get in, they will dig to destroy your walls, which is usually worse than giving them an &quot;easy&quot; way in strewn with traps). Some creatures like ants and dwarves sometimes prefer to dig their way in anyway, which can be nasty if you get caught out.

== Installations ==

Some [[installations]] require research to do. Install doors, bridges, barricades, torches, eyeballs and your prisoner heads in like fashion. You can also install various [[traps]].

Message boards can be built by Keepers and can be posted to by the community after you retire your dungeon.

[[File:Installations-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 Installations-Screenshot.png

== Summoning Extra Imps ==

Whenever you have enough gold, the [[keeper]] can summon more imps.  Simply click on the imp icon on your immigration panel. I usually add 4 more imps, for a total of 8, very near the beginning of the game, because this greatly speeds up your ability to dig and gather [[resources]].  I then usually add 4 more later on in the game but 12 total seems like enough for me to get things done. I'd rather save my gold for other things later.

== Researching technologies ==

Along the bottom panel there is a an icon of your keeper and the dungeon level you are on. If you remembered your tutorial steps, you will have attracted some basic creatures to your dungeon already, and killed a few easy enemies. You should be able to get a dungeon level or two at this point, to research some of the technologies, which you can experiment with. Clicking on your dungeon level brings up a list of all the technologies your dungeon has acquired, and also the technologies available to learn next. Some techs only become available by unlocking prerequisite ones, or by finding books in the outside world.

[[File:ResearchMenu-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 ResearchMenu-Screenshot.png

== Minions ==

You need to build other [[:Category:Rooms|rooms]] to attract monsters into your dungeon. Some [[minions]] will set up home with you if you just give them a dormitory to rest in. Other monsters would like places to train, or build things. Build a graveyard to keep corpses and you may be able to raise the dead. Other types of undead will come to practice rituals in a ritual room. Animals are attracted into cages, where they can sleep (You may not want too many of those at this stage, although cave bears are quite tough and flying beasts will add their superior line-of-sight to a party).

== Direct Control of a Minion ==

Select the minions icon (the horned face) to see a list of your current types of minion and other minion information. Click on each type of minion to see a list of each individual creature and their level. Click on any individual creature to see the minion management screen where you can control them. There are a list of extra commands when inside a minion, such as casting [[spells]]. After taking over a minion's will, press &quot;u&quot; to return to the &quot;dark god&quot; mode.

Press 't' to travel to other map sectors on the campaign map. Note that it is possible to select a whole team of minions, control them and invade. To do this, click on the team on the left panel of the minions tab, then select a team member and click &quot;control&quot;. Press 'g' to manage every move of each team member and to toggle that feature off again.

[[File:DirectControl-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 DirectControl-Screenshot.png

== Options on the minion management screen ==

You can banish, whip, directly control, rename, assign activities, assign equipment, lock equipment and view spells.

[[File:MinionManagement-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 MinionManagement-Screenshot.png

== Population limit ==

There is always a maximum population limit that your dungeon can hold and this is displayed on the bottom right of the screen. Any dungeon can support a population of 10 creatures plus imps. You can attract and command more creatures by building various rooms.  Impressive statues of yourself always increase the lure of your dungeon by 1 population. However, a decent statue costs gold or mana (depending on which version you are playing). Your monsters will not take your gold for themselves but you can offer them food in a pigsty to lure in another 4 creatures. When you are ready, you can build a throne for yourself and gain command of up to 10 more minions. Note that your dungeon size makes the forces of goodness feel threatened. Setting up a throne for yourself is totally offensive to many tribes, good and bad.

== Population management ==

You may need to enforce discipline using a whipping post and keep them happy by letting them get a piece of the combat action. Also, some creatures may outlive their usefulness. You have the option to banish them or send them on a suicide mission. Some keepers like to possess weak creatures and then drown the in a lake or river. Other players throw things at them, use them as target practice and kill them that way (It is possible to get some experience from them, but you should expect them to turn hostile and try to fight back).

== Tribes ==

You will have to travel to other map sectors to find the bases belonging to most of the bigger tribes and to do that, you will need to control a team or minion (see &quot;Direct Control of a Minion&quot;).

Look on the tribes strip to see information about other known tribes. Destroying a tribe will yield mana and allow you to pillage. Full conquest of all the tribes will allow you to retire victorious (only to be invaded by other players).

[[File:TribesStrip-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 TribesStrip-Screenshot.png

The world we live in is inhabited by many [[:Category: Creatures | creatures]]. For example, you may meet bandits, dragons, dwarves, elves, lizardmen, humans, spiders, scorpions, gnomes, undead, dark elves, minotaur, hydras, giant ants, elementalists, witchmen, kobolds, driads and cyclops... (there are a few more). Some creatures will hold you to ransom and attack you if you don't pay. You can usually see the reason an attacker is assaulting you on the tribes strip. There are allies you can recruit and shops where you can trade.

The &quot;righteous&quot; tribes will be happy to murder your kind, actually. Your role and allies are defined at the beginning of the game. However, most tribes can be provoked further by attacking or stealing things from them, setting yourself up as a king or queen, hoarding piles of gold etc.). If you are feeling really submissive, you can even pay them tribute to avoid any confrontation, however a showdown is inevitable eventually.

== Prisoners ==
Once you build a prison from iron, you can take prisoners. When fighting with humanoids, you can right click them to order their capture (take them alive). Once knocked out, they appear on your immigration panel and you have a while to capture them, before they die.

Next, build a torture table and torture your prisoners to try and convert them. Converted prisoners keep their stats and join your dungeon! Otherwise, execute them on a gallows for their heads to be hung up. Alternatively, absorb your prisoners with a doppleganger or else just keep them to work in your mines. Some prisoners have spells and useful skills, such as gnomes who are good at making jewellery.

If you have a small army and a large number of prisoners they may try to escape.

== Equipping an army ==

When you have a decent population of creatures with different skills and you have enough resources, it is worth thinking about equipment. You have two options here:

* Production queues
1) Some rooms will provide you with a production queue on the research tab. Here you can command production of weapons, armour, ammunition, jewelry, potions and some other things. It will cost resources, but your creatures are generally happy to produce these if they have the skills.  

* Looting
2) Some equipment can be got from invaders. You can also control a creature and go on a rogue-like assault of a hostile force nearby to get loot.

== Training an army ==

Some creatures learn spells in the library. Others gain levels by training against dummies in the training room and/or through real combat. Some creatures can train and learn spells, some can do neither. Better training facilities will get better results.

== Invaders ==

Rumours about your dungeon will spread as it grows. These will attract recruits but can also attract invaders. Invaders may be out to plunder your gold, gain combat experience or just to assassinate your [[keeper]]. Invaders may carry useful items to loot and can also help you gain combat experience. If you are overpowered by an invading force, such as a dragon you may need to evacuate your [[keeper]] out of a back door. Sometimes invaders may call off an assault. Most invaders are capable of tracking your keeper across the map.

== Exploring the Map ==

Directly control a minion by taking over its will. Explore the map using the arrow keys. Kill local monsters and tribes by commanding a party. New teams are set up by clicking &quot;New team&quot; on the [[minions]] tab. Then select individual creatures to add them to the team. Select the minion you want to lead your party and click command to control them. Think carefully before trying to loot a dragon's hoard or waking up a cyclops. Wolves naturally form their own teams. Some nocturnal animals will want to go out at night to hunt and also have good night vision.

Be careful while exploring, as you may bump into an unexpected situation. If you are lucky you will find friendly tribes you can recruit. You will also come across major enemies that you must defeat to win the game. Minor enemies that you can tolerate but may attack you occasionally and also small random settlements such as villages and inhabited caves, which will not be able to counter-attack against you. There are forest animals such as deer, foxes and boars. Don't get killed by a dog while wandering about at level 5 with no weapons and armour!

[[File:KilledByDog-Screenshot.png|1000px|link=]]
 KilledByDog-Screenshot.png

== Winning the game ==

Some monsters that you meet will be pleased to join your forces. Others will be hostile to you and perhaps hostile to the other settlements. Note that you may tolerate the existence of minor pests such as an old crazy cyclops. You must wipe out all the major forces on the tribes strip. There are some monsters such as dragons that may die when they invade you. You will normally need to go on the offensive at some point by forming a team and controlling a minion directly to kill all your rivals. Then you will get given a score, and that's how to become a notorious villain in the world of KeeperRL.

== Share your dungeon with other players ==

Don't forget to retire your dungeon (over an internet connection) to provide other people with the pleasure of bringing you to justice.

Enjoy!
