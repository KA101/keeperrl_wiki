This Quick Start written against KeeperRL Alpha 8.  Start here if you've never played before.


== Starting the Game ==

# Download the KeeperRL ZIP
# Unzip.  There is no install required.  The program &quot;keeper.exe&quot; is simply run in place.
# The Main Menu will come up.  The heading will be &quot;Choose your role&quot;.
# If you want a dungeon-management-type game, choose &quot;Keeper&quot;.  If you want to explore the world solo, choose &quot;Adventurer&quot;.  This quick start guide will focus on Keeper mode. (That is the title of the game, after all!)
# Leave the default settings (or change them if you want) and click on &quot;Done&quot;.

The game world will be generated and you will now be launched into the overhead view.  Here you can start building your dungeon.

Here you can find videos that explain the basics of the game.

== Victory ==

Claim victory by conquering all the local tribes.

Next, finalize your defenses and upload your map, so that adventurers belonging to other players can then invade it.

== Building Your First Dungeon ==

You start with your Keeper and 4 minion imps.

Along the bottom you will occasionally see text in red; these hints will provide you with ideas on what to do next.

Along the bottom are your resource stats:

* Gold
* Wood
* Copper
* Stone
* Mana

These resources are what is needed to build things in the dungeon.

The first thing to do is simply start digging!  On the top right are the various action icons.  The pickaxe icon (the leftmost one)
gives you the orders you can give your imps.  The top one is called &quot;Dig or cut tree&quot;.  Select that one and have the imps start
digging.

You can be as creative as you want when it comes to designing the layout of your dungeon.  The imps dig fairly quickly if they are not mining
ores; stick to the plain black area and they can dig large rooms in a short time.  You can hold down shift with the mouse and draw out
rectangles, too.

== Building Rooms and Gathering Resources ==

Typically the first thing I build is a storage room.  For my first storage room I usually go with a 10x20 rectangle.

Once the room is dug out, designate it as a storage room by clicking the &quot;Storage&quot; icon under the orders menu, then mark out
the space.  The floor will turn into black-and-white checkerboard pattern to let you know this is the storage area.

Now that you have a storage room, you can have the imps start mining ores and cutting down trees.  Simply use the &quot;Dig or cut tree&quot;
designation are dig out the areas with the various types of ores, and also mark trees.

== Summoning Extra Imps ==

Whenever you have enough mana, the keeper can summon more imps.  Simply click on the &quot;Summon&quot; icon and choose &quot;Summon imp&quot;.  Then click
anywhere on the map to have the imp appear there.  I usually add 4 more imps, for a total of 8, very near the beginning of the game, because
this greatly speeds up your ability to dig and gather resources.  I then usually add 4 more later on in the game but 12 total seems
like enough for me to get things done.  I'd rather save my mana for other things later.

== Library and Research ==

The next thing you want to build is a library.  The library is crucial because the keeper needs it to research any new skills.

Have the imps dig out another room, usually at least 10x20 but it can be bigger.  Make sure you have some wood stockpiled as well.  Then
simply build your library in that space from the orders menu.  You need a large library to research advanced skills and at this point
wood is plentiful so go ahead and bild a large library, 10x10 at least.  The keeper will usually immediately move to the library and
spend most of the time there.

Now that the library is built you can start researching skills.  Under the &quot;Creatures&quot; menu, there is an item called &quot;Library&quot;.  Clicking
on this brings up a list of all the skills the keeper has learned, and also the skills available to learn.  Some skills only become
available by unlocking prerequisite skills, or by finding books in the world.

The first skill I usually learn right away is crafting, because that is the skill needed to build anything else, like beds (which you will
need when you start to build your army).  So learn the crafting skill by clicking on it and spending your mana.  You should have enough
mana at this point.

== Minions ==

You need to build other rooms to attract monsters into your dungeon. Some minions will set up home with you if you give them a place to rest. Other monsters would like places to train, or build things. Some monsters will expect to be paid in exchange for their work. Build a graveyard to keep corpses and you may be able to raise the dead. Other types of undead will come to practice rituals in a ritual room.

== Treasure Room ==

When you have dug out some gold, you can store it in a treasure room. Once the gold is collected, you can use it to pay your minions. If you run out of gold, your minions will get demotivated. In the worst case, they will simply lie around in bed all day until you have money to pay them.


== Invaders ==

Rumors about your dungeon will spread as it grows. These will attract recruits but can also attract invaders. Invaders may be out to plunder your gold, gain combat experience or just to assassinate your keeper. Invaders may carry useful items to loot.
