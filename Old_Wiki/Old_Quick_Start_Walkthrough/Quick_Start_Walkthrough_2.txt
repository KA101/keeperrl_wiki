This Quick Start written against KeeperRL Alpha 8.  Start here if you've never played before.

# Download the KeeperRL ZIP
# Unzip.  There is no install required.  The program &quot;keeper.exe&quot; is simply run in place.
# The Main Menu will come up.  The heading will be &quot;Choose your role&quot;.
# If you want a dungeon-management-type game, choose &quot;Keeper&quot;.  If you want to explore the world solo, choose &quot;Adventurer&quot;.  This quick start guide will focus on Keeper mode. (That is the title of the game, after all!)
# Leave the default settings (or change them if you want) and click on &quot;Done&quot;.

The game world will be generated and you will now be launched into the overhead view.  Here you can start building your dungeon.

You start with your Keeper and 4 minion imps.

Along the bottom you will occasionally see text in red; these hints will provide you with ideas on what to do next.

Along the bottom are your resource stats:

* Gold
* Wood
* Copper
* Stone
* Mana

These resources are what is needed to build things in the dungeon.



More to come:
* Library
* Minions
* Crafting
* Alchemy
