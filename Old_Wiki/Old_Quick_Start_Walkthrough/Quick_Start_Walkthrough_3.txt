This Quick Start written against KeeperRL Alpha 8.  Start here if you've never played before.


== Starting the Game ==

# Download the KeeperRL ZIP
# Unzip.  There is no install required.  The program &quot;keeper.exe&quot; is simply run in place.
# The Main Menu will come up.  The heading will be &quot;Choose your role&quot;.
# If you want a dungeon-management-type game, choose &quot;Keeper&quot;.  If you want to explore the world solo, choose &quot;Adventurer&quot;.  This quick start guide will focus on Keeper mode. (That is the title of the game, after all!)
# Leave the default settings (or change them if you want) and click on &quot;Done&quot;.

The game world will be generated and you will now be launched into the overhead view.  Here you can start building your dungeon.

== Building Your First Dungeon ==

You start with your Keeper and 4 minion imps.

Along the bottom you will occasionally see text in red; these hints will provide you with ideas on what to do next.

Along the bottom are your resource stats:

* Gold
* Wood
* Copper
* Stone
* Mana

These resources are what is needed to build things in the dungeon.

The first thing to do is simply start digging!  On the top right are the various action icons.  The pickaxe icon (the leftmost one)
gives you the orders you can give your imps.  The top one is called &quot;Dig or cut tree&quot;.  Select that one and have the imps start
digging.

You can be as creative as you want when it comes to designing the layout of your dungeon.  The imps dig fairly quickly if they are not mining
ores; stick to the plain black area and they can dig large rooms in a short time.  You can hold down shift with the mouse and draw out
rectangles, too.

== Building Rooms and Gathering Resources ==

Typically the first thing I build is a storage room.  For my first storage room I usually go with a 10x20 rectangle.

Once the room is dug out, designate it as a storage room by clicking the &quot;Storage&quot; icon under the orders menu, then mark out
the space.  The floor will turn into black-and-white checkerboard pattern to let you know this is the storage area.

Now that you have a storage room, you can have the imps start mining ores and cutting down trees.  Simply use the &quot;Dig or cut tree&quot;
designation are dig out the areas with the various types of ores, and also mark trees.
