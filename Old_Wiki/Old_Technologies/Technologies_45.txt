__NOTOC__

Note that on most games it will be possible to have researched all technologies before the end of the game. However, you can often develop a game-winning strategy by exploiting just some of your options to their full potential.

Technologies can be researched when your dungeon gains enough xp to level up. Click on your dungeon level at the bottom of the screen.

== Pig Breeding ==
*Unlocks: [[Pigsty]]

Build a pigsty for up to 4 extra population
*To follow the strategy further, make statues and build a throne (later on).
*If you want to try and overwhelm with numbers, you may lose or take heavy casualties, this is because the rogue-like underlying physics does tend to favour one OP hero over lots of little baddies (Rogue-likes are all about slaughtering armies of enemies with one guy if you think about it - and this is partly true with keeper).
*You can go for the converted prisoners route. Cyclops, knights, dwarves, converted bosses. A high population will ensure prisoners can't escape and provide you with a way of capturing and converting bulks of prisoners. You will also need to build a prison.

== Archery ==
''Requires crafting''
* Unlocks :
** [[:Weapons#Short_Bow|Bows]]
** [[Archery range]]
*The archery way is to torture and convert driads and elven archers, then train them in an archery range. You should be able to get +35 ranged damage with their bow and have sight through trees.

== Traps ==
''Requires crafting''
* Unlocks :
** [[:Traps|Traps]]
*Lure them in to attack you and wipe them out with traps, but it can be tricky to do this right and you will need to experiment a lot to perfect this.

== Iron Working ==
''Requires crafting''
* Unlocks :
** [[:Manufactories#Forge|Forge]]
** [[Training_Room#Iron_dummy | Iron Training Dummies]]
*Early on you meet dwarves that usually have 2 handed iron weapons, so match their weaponry. You need iron-working and 2-handed weapon technologies. Iron working will get you the ability to build iron training dummies, so make sure you have trained up ogres to wield the weapons. 
*You also need this to go the adamantium route. The golems will need dealing with before you can max out training with the best training equipment and get the best weapons and armours.
*You can go the werewolf route. Regeneration and stealth with decent training and weapons. Hit and run.

== Two-handed Weapons ==
''Requires iron working'' 
* Unlocks :
** [[:Weapons#Two-handed|Two-handed weapons]]

== Jewellery == 
''Requires iron working'' 
* Unlocks :
** [[:Manufactories#Jeweler|Jeweler]]
*Jewellery can be very underestimated. It is worth following. Poison resistance can be important and allows you to take on the ants and explore gnome/dark elf dungeons safely. This gives you extra resources from the ants and sometimes powerful items from dungeons, which become easier to explore if you can survive a snake bite.

== Sorcery ==
* Unlocks :
** [[:Spells#Basic_Spells|Basic spells]]
*If you want to go down the sorcery path, you need to get the best spell casters, namely a warlock keeper with vampires and a vampire lord and some orc shaman.

== Advanced Sorcery ==
''Requires sorcery'' 
* Unlocks :
** [[:Spells#Basic_Spells|Advanced spells]]

== Master Sorcery ==
''Requires master sorcery'' 
* Alternative method for unlocking this : [[Consumables#Book_of_Master_Sorcery|Book of Master Sorcery]]
* Unlocks :
** [[:Spells#Master_Spells|Master spells]]

== Demonology ==
''Requires master sorcery'' 
* Summon demons to your dungeon by building demon shrines
*Research this option if you want to go the demon route. Get a dopple-ganger with permanent speed advantage maxed out and power up. Basically absorb everything that has good properties and not bad properties.
*Also gives you access to ghosts and succubus.
*Ghosts turn enemies insane when they get the first hit but after that they vanish. The effect is usually subtle but works well.

== Magical Weaponry ==
''Requires master sorcery'' 
* Create weapons that hit using magic damage and increase spell power
* Magical weapons combined with enchant weapon scrolls and fully trained warlock keepers and vampire lords are a real possibility for winning the game. Consider it as an option.

== Alchemy ==
* Unlocks :
** [[:Manufactories#Laboratory|Laboratory]]
** [[:Potions#Basic_Potions|Basic potions]]
*Take heal potions, slow down potions to throw, speed up potions to drink, melee resistance potions to drink, melee vulnerability potions to throw. Kit up on alchemy and mushrooms. This is the consumables route and if you want to do it, research the alchemy tree. The disadvantage is it costs you gold.

== Advanced Alchemy ==
''Requires alchemy'' 
* Alternative research method: [[Consumables#Book_of_Avanced_Alchemy|Book of Advanced Alchemy]]
* Unlocks :
** [[:Potions#Advanced_Potions|Advanced Potions]]

== Alchemical Conversion ==
''Requires alchemy'' 
* Lets you exchange gold for other resources in the brewery

== Beast Mutation ==
* Alternative research method: [[Consumables#Book_of_Beast_Mutation|Book of Beast Mutation]]
* Unlocks :
** [[:Legendary_Beast|Legendary Beast]]
*You can go the legendary beast route. Succubus pregnancy will get you some pretty nasty results.

== Humanoid Mutation ==
* Alternative research method: [[Consumables#Book_of_Humanoid_Mutation|Book of Humanoid Mutation]]
* Unlocks :
** [[:Legendary_Humanoid|Legendary Humanoid]]
*You can go for the legendary humans as a decent strategy. These guys are a bit random but can also use equipment unlike the beasts.
