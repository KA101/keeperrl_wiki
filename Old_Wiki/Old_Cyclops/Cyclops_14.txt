= Summary =
Cyclops are tough minor villains. Although one of the smaller bosses, often attacks earlier in the game. Once captured worth putting to the torture table for a chance at getting a very solid fighter. He gets very paranoid when your dungeon size is too large, so if you are next to a cyclops, try to stay small and stealthy until you have overpowered him.

= Strategy =
Cyclops get very threatened when they see the size of a dungeon growing in population. If you are near a local cyclops, try to avoid him and keep your population low. Never steal his mushrooms or grow a rowdy army until you want to kill him. He is a very powerful asset if converted through torture. Your imps can put him on a torture table and poke his eye with needles, and if you can break him withiout killing him, he will join forces with you as a minion. You will need to take him alive through.
