== Summary ==
Children of the dark elf community. They have little redeeming features except for night vision, stealth and magic resistance, that can be absorbed by dopplegangers.

They are reportedly ugly and have terrible manners (ugly is the new cute). If you are an enemy of dark elves then you can capture and convert them but honestly you are better off adopting someone else.
