When you start adventuring in the world of KeeperRL, it is best to choose an easy map to start with. Maps that other people have beaten.
If you have beaten a new map, that nobody else has beaten, consider updating this page with a guide for that map.

Story....

Visit the level 46 minotaur living upstairs from the starting castle. Take the stairs and avoid the minotaur (you won't be able to kill him). Soon you find the remains of a previous party who were defeated. Get the artifact weapon and escape alive with other loot.

Follow the road from the castle to the ransacked village. Look through the rubbish for strength gloves, healing potion etc. Ignore the elemental tower on the east side of the village because he isn't home.

There are some free mushrooms in a cave some way north. Ignore the bandits nearby and follow the mountain around to the southeast. Cross the river. Find the mountain door. Get prepared for a massive battle, eat strength and dexterity mushrooms. Break down the door and engage the enemy. Use the healing potion(s) if you are wounded in combat but try and use first aid kits instead. If your enemies are being healed by an orc shaman, back out to a different location and then try again.

Break your way into the keepers treasure hoard and take all the healing potions and scrolls especially. Look out for the artifact Surewind. Use all the weapon and armour enchantment scrolls on it. Slaughter the minions and then prepare for the final showdown with the keeper. Eat strength and dexterity mushrooms. Use the healing potions whenever wounded. Get close to the keeper and turn invisible with the invisibility potion (there is one). Sneak up on him and kill him hand to hand.

Story...

There is plenty of loot if you explore the starting castle. It is important to get the invisibility potion and the fire sphere scroll (for burning down the library). Step outside the castle and loot the Duke's corpse for armor and an artifact weapon. It is possible to head directly northeast, cross the river and have an early showdown with the keeper. Stay out of the way of his ranged attacks and take him on hand to hand as this keeper has very poor hand-to-hand damage.
