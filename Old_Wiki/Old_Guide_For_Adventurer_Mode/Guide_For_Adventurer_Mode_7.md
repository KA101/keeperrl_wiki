When you start adventuring in the world of KeeperRL, it is best to choose an easy map to start with. Maps that other people have beaten.
If you have beaten a new map, that nobody else has beaten, consider updating this page with a guide for that map.



* Tyrant:  Zannifer
* Land:    Ard
* Version: Alpha 16
* Victor:  Keeperman

Story....

Visit the level 46 minotaur living upstairs from the starting castle. Take the stairs and avoid the minotaur (you won't be able to kill him). Soon you find the remains of a previous party who were defeated. Get the artifact weapon and escape alive with other loot.

Follow the road from the castle to the ransacked village. Look through the rubbish for strength gloves, healing potion etc. Ignore the elemental tower on the east side of the village because he isn't home.

There are some free mushrooms in a cave some way north. Ignore the bandits nearby and follow the mountain around to the southeast. Cross the river. Find the mountain door. Get prepared for a massive battle, eat strength and dexterity mushrooms. Break down the door and engage the enemy. Use the healing potion(s) if you are wounded in combat but try and use first aid kits instead. If your enemies are being healed by an orc shaman, back out to a different location and then try again.

Break your way into the keepers treasure hoard and take all the healing potions and scrolls especially. Look out for the artifact Surewind. Use all the weapon and armour enchantment scrolls on it. Slaughter the minions and then prepare for the final showdown with the keeper. Eat strength and dexterity mushrooms. Use the healing potions whenever wounded. Get close to the keeper and turn invisible with the invisibility potion (there is one). Sneak up on him and kill him hand to hand.

Story...

There is plenty of loot if you explore the starting castle. It is important to get the invisibility potion and the fire sphere scroll (for burning down the library). Step outside the castle and loot the Duke's corpse for armor and an artifact weapon. It is possible to head directly northeast, cross the river and have an early showdown with the keeper. Stay out of the way of his ranged attacks and take him on hand to hand as this keeper has very poor hand-to-hand damage.

* Land:    Telley
* Version: Alpha 16
* Victor:  Keeperman

Story...

Get equipment from the castle. You need The artifact Whiritch, +10 bow, 250 arrows, Chain +6, boots, gloves, helm, defense amulet, Fire ring, Poison ring and first aid kits.

Take the road west, cross the bridge and head south at the T-Junction. Get the speed boots and healing potions from the ghost town and head back to the castle. Travel east to the spider's cave with cobwebs outside. Get an extra healing potion from the corpse in the trees.
Head south and cross the river. Go east and round the mountain until you find the mountain door. Break down the door and then step outside to avoid the boulder trap. You will need to clear out the dungeon next. There is a harpy that often goes invisible, watch out for her.

When you open the door and see a boulder trap in plain view, proceed with great caution. Move into a position where the boulder is northeast of you and do the following moves to navigate all the boulder traps: nw, ne, n, n, n, break down door, n, n, nw, nw, ne, e, e, se, sw, wait for boulder, ne, break down door. One wrong move and you may die.

Cross the bridge and enter the throne room to the north. Break down the library door and take on the keeper who will probably be invisible.

* Land:    Avantadia
* Version: Alpha 16
* Victor:  Keeperman

Story...

Sort through the items left in the castle and equip. The minotaur below the castle is dead, so get anything useful from there. Scrolls and healing potions are good. Keep a look out for an invisibility potion, you will need one.

Head down the south road and go east at the junction. Enter the destroyed elven settlement. Get healing potions and arrows from dead archers. Find the artifact Corpal Band. Get the defense amulet and fire and poison rings. Cross the river to the north. Enter the dark elf cave in the mountain from the south.

Descend the stairs to the bottom level. Head east cautiously. The enemy will try to put you to sleep, which is fatal. Go invisible using the potion and go straight for the keeper hand to hand.
