Right now, the only orders in the orders menu is [[Prioritize Task]]

Prioritize Task is necessary to make imps do certain things. You can probably toggle tasks on and off in a soft manner, allowing for tasks to become prioritized. It is, for example, necessary to prioritize a fetch items job on a square with this tool.
