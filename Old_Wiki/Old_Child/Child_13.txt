''Stealthy

==Summary==
Peasant children are stealthy and make good food for dopplegangers. Evil keepers love to have an extensive child labour program. Modern, progressive dictators really care a lot about providing employment to vulnerable orphans.

== Base Stats ==
*Damage:8
*Body size:Medium

*Skill:Stealth

=Child (spider food)=
*Damage:2
*Body size:Medium
*Entangled:Yes
*Blind:Yes
*Defense:2

Don't absorb the spider food unless you want a blind doppleganger. These children are stored for eating and are actually beyond help, even if you are playing a character that cares about morality. Sorry.
