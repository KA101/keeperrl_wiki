== Summary ==
Lives at the bottom of his own dungeon running his tribe. Reasonable at spells and fighting. Worth taking captive for that reason.

If you don't want a recruitment pact with the dark elves then he can be killed and plundered. He often carries worthwhile equipment and isn't particularly useful to anyone. In fact the world will thank you for it, not that popularity lasts long these days.
