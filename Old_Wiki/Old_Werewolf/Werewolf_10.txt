== Summary ==
A stealthy, regenerating fighter. Has a reasonable early game unarmed attack if you are unable to find them a weapon. Night vision, regeneration, resistance to magic and stealth add up to a good snack for a doppleganger, although once fully trained make a great solo in their own right. They can level up many levels by killimg enemy cteatures. A few werewolves additionally have an ambush ability allowing them to hide themselves and attack by surprise.
