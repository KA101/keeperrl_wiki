==Suggestions for simple changes to workshop.txt==
*Delete the line containing &quot;WoodenStaff&quot; under the &quot;# Workshop&quot; section, to remove wooden staffs from the workshop.
*Reduce the cost of golden staffs in the line containing &quot;GoldenStaff&quot; on the &quot;# Forge&quot; section.
*Change the line containing &quot;RESTED&quot; in the # Jeweller&quot; section. Change &quot;RESTED&quot; to &quot;INVISIBLE&quot; to sell rings of invisibility instead.
*Change an exchange rate for resources in the &quot;# Lab section&quot;. Experiment with changing the numbers.
*Test the changes
