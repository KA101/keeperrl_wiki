== Introduction to Endless Mode ==

*The endless mode is all about defending your dungeon against incoming waves of attackers, trying to survive for as long as possible.
*Each wave will tend to be stronger than the last
*You will get mana rewards for resisting each attack wave.
*Attack waves are randomised but are balanced for similar difficulty in each game.
*Endless Mode has a separate highscore for longest survival.
*It is still possible to take your minions adventuring in other map sectors on the master map (and there are big benefits to doing this). Your score is frozen until you return to defend your main base map.

== Strategies for progressing in Endless Mode ==

*In the early game build your dungeon as you normally would in a campaign game
*Go adventuring as soon as practical and capture elven archers, human archers or driads. You need these for clearing waves of golems that are weak to ranged attacks.
*You need to hunt these archers with a bat on your team for its superior vision, otherwise an arrow is likely to come flying out of nowhere and kill you!
*Take some regular workers captive to mine out your dungeon quicker (time pressure is important).
*Get some undead in your dungeon. Lizardmen normally attack near the beginning and poison regular troops.
*Build boulder traps next to web traps to defend (This strategy should get you through to mid-game before you run out of stone).
*Aim for legends, dopplegangers, vampire lord, adamantium kit, healing and speed potions
*Also aim to capture all humanoids that attack your dungeon
*Keep the allied dungeons for now. Get a rogue-like party together and clear the other map sectors. Capture cyclops, vampire lords and minotaur from other map sectors.
*The best minions are adventurers, minotaurs, witchmen, lizardmen, cyclops and invading ogres. These get better and better each wave.
*Consider going on a rogue-like adventure with a handful of your best minions, especially adventurers. Dark elf and gnome dungeons are good. Go for artifacts in particular.
*Remember only 50% of prisoners survive the torture and will join you.
*Stay alive by keeping ahead of the enemy waves.
*Get adamantium axes and armours from the forge. You will need to take out the adamantium golems to do this.
*Healing and speed potions from the brewery.
*Kit up creatures you tortured from the wave before.
*Train those minions up in your dungeon.
*Get healers and spell casters
*To last as long as possible in endless mode, build up the very best possible team (Keep everything with attack and defence over +70).
*After turn 50,000 you are now in the end game. You will be hit by many back-to-back waves of red dragons that will eventually wipe you out!
*If you get past turn 100,000k then you found a bug. Let us all know and it will be fixed :)
