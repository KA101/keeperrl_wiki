== Introduction to Endless Mode ==

*The endless mode is all about defending your dungeon against incoming waves of attackers, trying to survive for as long as 
possible.
*Each wave will tend to be stronger than the last
*You will get mana rewards for resisting each attack wave.
*Attack waves are randomised but are balanced for similar difficulty in each game.
*Endless Mode has a separate highscore for longest survival.
*It is still possible to take your minions adventuring in other map sectors on the master map (and there are big benefits to doing this). Your score is frozen until you return to your main base map.

== Strategies for progressing in Endless Mode ==

*In the early game build your dungeon as you normally would in a campaign game
*Go adventuring as soon as practical and capture elven archers, human archers or driads. You need these for clearing waves of golems that are weak to ranged attacks.
*Build boulder traps next to web traps to defend (This strategy should get you through to mid-game before you run out of stone).
*Aim to capture all humanoids that attack your dungeon
*Aim for legends, dopplegangers, vampire lord, adamantium kit, healing and speed potions
*Get a rogue-like party together and clear the other map sectors and go for artifacts.
*Stay ahead of the waves of invaders by
