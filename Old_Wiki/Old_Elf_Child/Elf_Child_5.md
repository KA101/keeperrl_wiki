== Summary ==

Elf Children can provide a good line of sight for parties, being able to see through trees. They sometimes become food for dopplegangers who can gain stealth, elf vision and magic resistance. They are not high in demand though. Keepers can usually find better alternatives, so they are captured when you have spare space in your prison and want help with haulage and mining work. They often just get put to the sword instead.
