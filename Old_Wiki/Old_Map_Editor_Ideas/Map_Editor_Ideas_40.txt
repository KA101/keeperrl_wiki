There is a possibility that Alpha 25 will include a map editor. Please provide your ideas here.

*Example: Create a new tribe called &quot;River Pirates&quot;, with a loyalty to bandits. Make them a minor villain, select the view id for bandits. Give them a trigger of gold and put them in a forest biome.

== Full Terrain editor ==
*Select a tribe on the map  (drop down)
*Place existing object (to be owned by selected tribe)
*Remove existing object
(Reuse existing UI)
*Claim tile (For selected tribe)
(designating villain territory)
*Add creature to current tribe (creature id drop down)
(Summon creature with correct tribe ID)
(placing creatures and assigning them to villain)
*Retire map (upload it).
*Example:Create a mountain map, Increase the size of the rivers. Make a secret cave 
along the side of a river that you must swim or fly to.
*Click on creature to edit it.

== Creature editor ==
*Rename
*Banish
*Control creature

*Example. Create some bandits in the secret cave. Change their name to pirates and make them tougher. Give the pirate leader a bit higher attack. Give the pirates the swimming skill so they can leave the cave by crossing the river.
*Edit a creature's item (Click on it)

== Item editor ==
*Change name of item
*Increase/Decrease item's attack (weapon)
*Increase/Decrease item's defense (armour)
*Edit lasting effect (ring, potion)
*Edit effect (Mushroom, scroll)
*Destroy item
*Example - take the pirate captain's sword. Name it a great pirate sword and increase the damage a bit.

== Additional notes ==
*It may help to have a dungeon master avatar when editing maps. He could be a place-holder who looks like a keeper but disappears when you retire the map.
*It could help to freeze the game turns so things stay where you put them.
*Instead of dropdowns the enums could each have an icon you can select them with. Tribeids, creatureids, items,effectids, skillids, spellids etc.
*Another way of adding and removing spells, skills and permanent effects might be to show them all and toggle them on/off. Eg. Toggle blindness effect on an old blind pirate - putting &quot;blindness&quot; in a green font when you click on it to show blindness is switched on. Make the blind pirate slower and give him an injured leg in the same way.
