Hi,

There is a possibility that Alpha 25 will include a map editor. Please provide your ideas here.

== Additional notes ==
*It may help to have a dungeon master avatar when editing maps. He could be a place-holder who looks like a keeper but disappears when you retire the map.
*It could help to freeze the game turns so things stay where you put them.
*Instead of dropdowns the enums could each have an icon you can select them with. Tribeids, creatureids, items,effectids, skillids, spellids etc.
*Another way of adding and removing spells, skills and permanent effects might be to show them all and toggle them on/off. Eg. Toggle blindness effect on a blind witch - putting &quot;blindness&quot; in a green font when you click on it to show blindness is switched on.
