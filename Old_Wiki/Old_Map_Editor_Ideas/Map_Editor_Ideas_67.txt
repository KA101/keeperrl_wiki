There is a possibility that Alpha 25 will include a map editor. Please provide your ideas here.

*Example: Create a new tribe called &quot;River Pirates&quot;, with a loyalty to bandits. Make them a minor villain, select the view id for bandits. Give them a trigger of gold and put them in a forest biome.

*Click the &quot;Generate Terrain&quot; Button to generate a map and move on to the Terrain Editor. (The new tribe has no creatures in it yet).

== Full Terrain editor ==
*Purpose - Edit every aspect of the map provided it still produces a valid save file!

*Option to retire the map (upload it).

*Example: Increase the size of the rivers. Make a secret cave along the side of a river that you must swim to or fly into. Select the tribe named &quot;river pirates&quot; and summon some bandits (tribe ID = bandit)

*Click on the creatures (example: the bandits) to edit them.

== Creature editor ==
*Purpose - Edit creatures that are on the map (either from map generation or summoning them)

*Rename

*Banish

*Control creature

*Press 'u' at any time to return to the terrain editor.

*Move it about

*Summon equipment for creature (F11?)

*Add/Remove skill (Drop down list)

*Increase/Decrease stats (Click on stat)

*Add/Remove spell (Click on spell)

*Add/Remove training abilities (Click on training)

*Edit AI (Leader/Fighter/Civilian/Prisoner)

*Edit gender (m/f/it)

*Edit body size (huge/large/small/tiny)

*Restore and injure body parts

*Example. Create some bandits in the secret cave. Change their name to pirates and make them tougher. Give the pirate leader a bit higher attack. Give the pirates the swimming skill so they can leave the cave by crossing the river.

*Edit items in a creature's inventory (Click on them, to go to the item editor)

== Item editor ==

*Press 'u' at any time to return to the creature editor and again to return to the terrain editor.

*Change name of item

*Increase/Decrease item's attack (weapon)

*Increase/Decrease item's defense (armour)

*Edit lasting effect (ring, potion)

*Edit effect (Mushroom, scroll)

*Destroy item

*Example - take the pirate captain's sword. Name it a great pirate sword and increase the damage a bit.

== Additional notes ==

*It may help to have a dungeon master avatar when editing maps. He could be a place-holder who looks like a keeper but disappears when you retire the map.

*It could help to freeze the game turns so things stay where you put them.

*Instead of dropdowns the enums could each have an icon you can select them with. views for different: Tribe Ids, creature Ids, Item Ids, Effect Ids, Skill Ids, Spell Ids etc.

*Another way of adding and removing spells, skills and permanent effects might be to show them all and toggle them on/off

*Example: Rename a pirate to &quot;blind old pirate&quot;. Toggle blindness effect on the blind pirate - putting &quot;blindness&quot; in a red font when you click on it to show blindness is switched on. Make the blind pirate slower and give him an injured leg by clicking on &quot;slow&quot; and his intrinsic leg attack turning them red.
