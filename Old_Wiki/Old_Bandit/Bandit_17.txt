''They are after gold.

==Summary==
They are common in mountainous areas and like to inhabit caves. They can see your wealth and once the temptation is too much, try to access your [[:Treasure_Room|treasure room]] to steal the gold and then run away. If you are overpowered early on in the game, they can be bribed to leave you alone. Such cowardice is normally very much less satisfying than killing them all and taking their swords for your army.
