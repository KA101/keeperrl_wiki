== Summary ==

Easy to kill with a weapon, having a low defense. They are unable to compete with armoured and armed units. However, they have a relatively high damage and once they sink their teeth into you can do some harm to the careless.

Man's best friend but a keeper's enemy. Unless you are playing as a white knight you will either let them be or fight them. White knights get to recruit dogs for free and without paying for a population point. A small pack of dogs can help to swell an army somewhat.
