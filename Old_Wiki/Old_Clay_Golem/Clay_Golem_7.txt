==Summary==
These slow creatures often attack in waves during endless mode. Occasionally, lone golems are found wandering gnomish dungeons. They only have a defense of 19, but are a little bit harder to kill with a sword or axe due to their melee resistance.

Cold and mindless, they literally have a heart of stone. Sometimes helpful if you are running low on it.
