Is there a place where this Wiki shows some depth? KeeperRL's big brother Dwarf Fortress made a point of having a well-organised, community supported wiki and it makes a world of difference when you play:

* Learning curve! At this point let's not expect everything to be perfect, but common gameplay and your usual tricks ''should be documented''.
* Where are we now? I strongly suggest '''categorizing pages with version number''', cause most of them have outdated / mixed content. [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Categories Some help about categories].

I could not find a talk page here so I'm waiting for suggestions, otherwise I guess I'll just start organizing stuff around. Let's talk!
