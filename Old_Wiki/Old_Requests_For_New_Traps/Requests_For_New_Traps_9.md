== Explosion Trap ==
* Build Cost: 100 mana
* Damage: 15
* Damage type: Physical
* Special effects: Pushes invaders backwards, like the word-of-power spell
* Concept: What is the basic concept behind this?
* Purpose in game: What makes this thing unique?
* Optional features: What other things could be added to make it even better?
* Discussion: Discuss the idea here.


== Confusion Trap ==
* Build Cost: Scroll of Deception + 100 wood (100 wood to reset possible?)
* Damage: 0
* Damage type: no damage
* Special effects: causes mob to loose friend/foe target prejudice. Will turn on its allies unless attacked by keeper's minions. Each hit from keeper's minion has chance of breaking confusion.
* Concept: Turn enemies on each other.
* Purpose in game: ^
* Optional features: Enemies will fight against turned mob. The mob will have a will saving throw to resist confusion and every x turns get a saving throw to break confusion.

== Pitfall Trap ==
* Build Cost: 30 Stone
* Damage: Moderate
* Damage type: Physical
* Special effects: Works similarly to the web trap but it does damage and can kill a Wounded enemy.
* Concept: Well, How could you call yourself an '''Eevil''' Villain if you can't build BASIC pitfall traps 
* Purpose in game: there is a severe lack of devious traps as it is.
* Optional features: Does no damage or even activates for flying enemies. Pitfall traps cannot be built one tile in any direction around an already existing Pitfall Trap.

== Spike Trap ==
* Build Cost: 10 iron
* Damage: Pierceing low damage
* Damage type: Physical
* Special effects: Stuns the enemy for one turn (Skewering them), wounds them and makes them bleed (they've just had a 8 foot spike run through their torso they aren't happy campers anymore). death will soon follow from bleeding if untreated in an expedient manner.
* Concept:  
* Purpose in game: there is a severe lack of devious traps as it is.
* '''Optional''' features: insta kills low level enemies (12 or under). theres a chance the spike will miss the intended target (IE: the target wasn't lined up with the trap and the spike ''just'' misses you.
