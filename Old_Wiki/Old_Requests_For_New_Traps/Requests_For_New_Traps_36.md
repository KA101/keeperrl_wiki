== Spike Trap ==
* Build Cost: 30 iron

  Death will soon follow from bleeding if untreated in an expedient manner.
* Purpose in game: There is a severe lack of devious traps as it is.
* '''Optional''' Features: insta kills low level enemies (12 or under).
  Theres a chance the spike will miss the intended target
  (IE: the target wasn't lined up with the trap and the spike ''just'' misses you).
