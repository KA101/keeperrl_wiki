=Converting prisoners=
*You need torture tables, a population slot and a suitable prisoner to convert.
*Not having a population slot will leave a prisoner's torture task greyed out.
*Failure chance is 50%, which means they die without converting to your dungeon
 Converted prisoners will join your dungeon, keeping their previous stats and characteristics

=Best types of prisoners to torture= 
*[[Cyclops]] make excellent fighters when fully equipped
*The [[Vampire Lord]] is a powerful spell caster
*[[Elven Archer|Elven archers]] and [[Driad|driads]] are better archers than you can recruit, so they are often worth it
*[[dwarf|Dwarves]] make excellent diggers in your mines
*[[knight|Knights]] have melee resistance
*[[Archer|Human archers]] are the best archers.
*Most bosses are worth it, so [[Elf Lord]], [[Dwarf Baron]] and the [[Duke]]
*Lizardmen have a speed bonus and an optional poison +8 attack unarmed
*The [[elementalist]] sucks, he can't even summon elementals, so don't bother with him
*You aren't likely to find a [[minotaur]] (sometimes they live below castles and they are powerful)
*The [[lizardman chief]] is a bit special
*[[warrior|Warriors]] from the Viking tribe are very good
*When you come up against enemy keepers, some of the minions will be better than yours if you can get them
*You can capture enemy [[keeper|keepers]]
*In endless mode, always take any prisoners you can get, because they will be buffed
 Basically, you can (and should) capture any powerful humanoid to try and convert them through torture.

=Looking after prisoners=
*If you don't mind looking after prisoners, you can keep them as slaves to build, dig and mine for you.
*Prisoners will try and escape if there are too many of them and you do not have enough population to keep them living in fear.
*[[Wolf|Wolves]] are good at looking after prisoners because you can get a whole pack of them for 1 population slot
*Sometimes executing prisoners is a good idea, if you have too many and want to provoke the self righteous by displaying your prisoner heads outside your dungeon.
 Try not to capture more prisoners than you can look after
