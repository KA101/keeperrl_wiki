=Converting prisoners=
*You need torture tables, a population slot and a suitable prisoner to convert
*Failure chance is 50%, which means they die without converting to your dungeon

=Types of prisoners=
*[[Elven Archer|Elven archers]] and [[driads|driads]] are better archers than you can recruit, so they are often worth it
*[[dwarf|Dwarves]] make excellent diggers in your mines
*[[knight|Knights]] have melee resistance
*[[archers|Human archers]] are good
*Most bosses are worth it, so [[elf lord]], [[dwarf barons]] and [[the duke]]
*Lizardmen have a speed bonus and an optional poison +8 attack unarmed
*The [[elementalist]] sucks, he can't even summon elementals, so don't bother with him
*You aren't likely to find a [[minotaur]] (sometimes they live below castles and they are powerful)
*The [[lizardman chief]] is a bit special
*[[warrior|Warriors]] from the Viking tribe are very good
*When you come up against enemy keepers, some of the minions will be better than yours if you can get them
*You can capture enemy [[keeper|keepers]]
*In endless mode, always take any prisoners you can get, because they will be buffed
*Basically, capture any powerful humanoid

=Looking after prisoners=
*Try not to capture more prisoners than you can look after
*[[Wolf|Wolves]] are good at looking after prisoners because you can get a whole pack of them for 1 population slot
