__NOTOC__
''Summoned by [[:Spells#Deception|deception]] spell.''
A copy of the caster used to distract enemies.
The creature that summoned the illusions views them as transparent to differentiate between themselves and the illusions.
To other creatures(that did not summon the illusions) they appear the same as the caster.
