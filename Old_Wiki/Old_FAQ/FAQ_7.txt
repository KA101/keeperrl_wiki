=Q: Why does my save file keep getting bigger the longer I play for?=
*A: The number of entities in the game tends to go up. For example, new monsters migrate into the game with their equipment. When they die they leave equipment, corpses (and bytes) behind.

=Q: Are the ideas, requests and contributions found [[Player_ideas,_requests_and_contributions|here]] actually in the game?=
*A:Most of them are not. Some of the however, have been used. Others are planned.

=Q: Are there any mods for this game?=
*A: Yes, the source code is open, so feel free to mod it as much as you like. However, most mods become out of date very quickly and there is very little in terms of modding support. You need to be a developer who can write code.
