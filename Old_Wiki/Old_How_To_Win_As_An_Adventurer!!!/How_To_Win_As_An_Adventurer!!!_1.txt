== The basics ==

* Keeperrl adventurer mode RPG is hardcore and old style.
* All the maps you face were generated by another player's dungeon game.
* The maps are completely unfiltered. Some of the maps are virtually unwinnable.
* Unlike most modern RPGs, there is nothing forcing you to level up before facing the final boss.
* If you try and storm the dungeon at level 3 wielding a knife you will die. Don't be silly! Don't complain!


== The game set up ==

* Map selection is the single most important choice of the game.
* Choose a map that someone else has already beaten for a fair chance. Look at the stats.
* If the map is lagging or impossible, choose another. (Some maps stop lagging if you kill all the imps on it).
* The second most important choice is the handicap
* If you like a decent chance, go with maximum handicap
* Scout out the map you wish to play to get a feel for it


== First kill all the imps ==

Before you do anything else, kill all the keepers imp's so he cant arm any more traps or improve his armoury any further
Tempt them out of the dungeon by knocking down their front door - shoot them when the come out to investigate!
* Armed traps - Try to get a feel for these during a quick scout at the beginning, before committing to the map.
* With all the imps dead, there is a limit to the number of traps you will face in the dungeon.


== Stay alive but explore the map ==

* Rest your cursor on all enemies to judge their stats and level before attacking.
* If your enemy has higher defense and attack stats than you, run away.
* Alternativly find somewhere to hide and use the h key to escape.
* If you think the enemy has a ranged attack, avoid lines of sight where it can shoot you or potion you
* Slower enemies without a ranged attack are just asking to be shot by you.


== Night beasts, minor dungeons and tribes ==

* Vultures: Small amount of XP and score. Just enough to level you up from level 3 to 4.
* Orcs and harpies provide some low level XP if required.
* Neutral and hostile tribes provide bonus score, XP and loot. Shoot arrows at them to force into combat. Care needed.
* If you don't need XP or loot then keep the tribes alive for now. You may need them later.
* Werewolves are the worst of the keeper's night explorers. Be careful if you meet one.
* Kill the keeper's other night animals if safe to do so and you need xp.
* Orcs when you are high level: Herd them into the keeper's traps during daylight hours to get past the traps.
* Gnomes: Shoot some with arrows to declare war. Loot for potions. Herd into traps if desperate.
* Dark elves: Shoot to declare war. Loot.
* Dark elf lord: Look out for an artifact weapon like a silver sword to slay undead!
* Dwarves: Some survivors of the dwarven tribe may exist in lower dungeons but will be hostile. Use for XP/Score.
* Vampire Lord, Minotaur, etc: XP. Loot. Only if you can get the advantage in combat.
* Cyclops, driads, other minor tribes and creatures. XP. Loot.


== Equip yourself ==

* Do not overload yourself. Watch out for your speed going down! Speed below 100 is bad.
* Consider using leather instead of metal armour for speed.
* Important potions: invisibility (best), speed, blindness, sleep, slowness, healing, poison
* Important scrolls: teleport (best), armour enchantment, weapon enchantment, flies, deception, fire sphere
* Decent mushrooms: Strength, dexterity
* Weapons: silver sword artifact (best), or high stat artifact, use light weapons at low level, bow, arrows
* Armour: telepathy helm (best), speed boots, dex gloves, high stat armour, low weight armour for speed bonus.
* Jewelry: 1 fire ring, 1 poison ring, healing or defense amulet


== Collecting Magic ==

* Potions, scrolls and mushrooms are the only way adventurers can use magic. Get as many usable ones as possible.
* They are light to carry.
* Blindness, sleep, slowness and poison are better used when dex/ranged accuracy is higher, since they are thrown.
* Armour enchantment - Choose a good piece of armour and remove the rest to target the enchantment at
the remaining worn armour.
* Try to keep a teleport spell for emergencies.
* Try to get an invisibility potion to take out the keeper at the end.


== Safely accessing the enemy dungeon ==

* It is not normally time to take on the enemy army or keeper yet.
* Invisible opponents: Generally, you have 3 options -  go invisible, run, or die!
* Running is best because invisibility spells have a cooldown
* Get the enemy to use all his invisibility potions up during the mid-game.
* Web trap: You can still fight from within the web. Teleport if you are webbed and attacked by stronger enemies.
* Poison trap: Works in your favour if you have a poison resistance ring
* Suprise and panic traps: Trigger the trap and run away again
* Potion throwing enemies and archers: Shoot them or avoid direct lines of sight or hit them with slow, sleep, blindness, poison
* Undead: They are tough. You really need the silver sword artifact, or else behead/dismember them
* Unarmed traps: If you discover the enemy's workshop you may find unarmed traps. Take the boulder and web ones for later.
* Loot: Potions, scrolls, mushrooms especially. Find the labs and storage rooms and empty them of all the useful items. Check corpses for these items after killing enemies.


== Boulder/web combos ==

If there is a boulder trap with a web trap in front and you get webbed, you must use any teleport spell immediately. Without that you will die. If you already know that trap is on the map, then herd neutral or hostile tribes into it. They will die not you. Alternatively, trigger the trap using deception, flies or fire sphere scrolls.

* Lone boulder trap: Often you are able to trigger the trap and then step aside. If not, treat it the same way as a boulder web combo and trigger the trap without stepping near it.


== Defeating the enemy army ==

* Orc shaman: Take them out ASAP because they go invisible and also heal other monsters.
* Always consider your enemy before attacking. Rest your cursor on an enemy to judge their stats and level.
* Pick them off one at a time.
* Fight enemies in corridors in preference to rooms. With multiple enemies, you can fight one at a time.
* Try to fix it so that you get the first hit.
* Compare their stats to your own.
* To be reasonably safe you need attack and defense about 10 points higher than your opponent.
* Wounded opponents however, are normally safe to fight.
* Also blind and sleeping opponents are safer. When you are invisible, most enemies of a similar level are fairly safe to kill.
* Realise when you are about to die and retreat. Use a speed potion if you need to.
* Take being wounded VERY seriously. Never just keep on fighting.
* Retreat and use a first aid kit. If you are chased, go for a speedy retreat and a heal potion.
* Don't heal yourself in battle, even with a heal potion.
* The enemy's population limit: Kill off the high level monsters and deliberately clog him up with useless ravens etc.


== Room based strategies ==

* Weaken down the army as much as possible before trying to sort out the training room or library.
* Pigsty - This is a great place to visit. Kill the enemy when he gets hungry and comes for lunch - one by one.
* Workshops - Once the imps are dead, these are a great place for goblins to make you traps. The keeper can't arm them.
* Laboratories - Leave little goblins happily making potions. You can usually aquire them yourself later
* Dormitories - Catch monsters in their sleep. When you have cleared the dormitory, pick off monsters one by one as they
  enter for a nap. Finally, burn down the dormitory so the keeper can't recruit orc shaman healers.
* Forges - There is almost always a surplus of weapons and armour. Ignore them. Kill inhabitants. Pick off workers as
* Jewellers - Amulets and rings. Not useful unless you missed these from the start.
* Ritual rooms - These undead are often pretty useless to the keeper. Consider leaving the ghosts alone to do their rituals.
* Beast lairs - Often no need to kill the weak monsters in here. Werewolves and legendary beasts can cause a problem and are worth killing if you can.
* Graveyards - Zombies and vampires tend to train and you don't want that. Kill them when they go to their grave to sleep. A silver sword is very useful to do this.
* Libraries: Can be burnt to the ground with fire sphere. Vampires and orc shaman here. Vampires are worse.
* If the keeper is living in the library avoid taking him on surrounded by shaman and vampires.
* Training rooms - Often where you find the keeper. Can be full of the worst armed units
they enter.


== Make war using magic ==

* The magic available is different on each map. This forces you to improvise.
* Going invisble is your single best move. Try to keep one in reserve. Speed is also great.
* Blinding enemies with potions seems to be like going invisible but the potion has to hit your target (dex needed).
* If you can't afford to go invisible, fast or blind them...Put them to sleep, slow them down or poison them (these
are weaker potions). Again, dexterity is needed.
* Scrolls: teleport (You need this whenever you are about to die). Other scrolls may come in handy.
* Enchant up your best weapon and armours. When the traps have now been dealt with, use the extra deception, flies and 
fire sphere. Fire sphere is also useful in burning down some rooms.
* Use Strength and dexterity mushrooms when you most need a buff.
* Don't let yourself die when you still have loads of options available to use.


== Planting traps ==

Boulders and web traps are worth arming against the enemy. Try and put them somewhere that you expect the keeper or high level minions to go. Web/boulder combo works against your enemy as well as against you.



== Winning the game ==

* Killing the end boss is always dangerous. Don't come this far and just rush it.
* Use up your spare traps and magic to weaken down the keeper's army.
* Send vollies of arrows into the keepers location (often a training room or library)

You can sometimes execute the tyrant keeper in a ranged shootout, although he may still have some army left and he will also heal himself. When you turn up, the first thing he normally does is to go invisible for about 15 turns. This will wear off and has a large cooldown, so just retreat and come back in a few turns. Now it is your chance. Go invisible. Speed
yourself. Buff strength and dex. Trap him if you can. Kill him to win the game.
