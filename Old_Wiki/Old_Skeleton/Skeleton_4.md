[[File:skeleton.png|100px|link=]] ''Undead minion

==Summary==
A cheap unit with fair attack and defense, thrives primarily with archery.

This minion is not weak against sunlight and is delightfully expendable.  Do you have extra weapons and gear you will never use late game?  Grab a skeleton, load your little buddy up, and go attack something with no regrets when he dies.  Well dies again.  This can expose new parts of the map, trigger traps your nicer minions might break a nail on and possibly even kill a thing or two!  He doesn't mind.  Look at that happy toothy grin!
