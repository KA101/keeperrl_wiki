== Summary ==

A warrior that is good at healing, with a low spell cool-down. They have an ok base damage and can be recruited with gold once their lower stronghold is contacted at the bottom of their dungeon.

Combat skills are not spectacular but not aweful either. Elven swords are good one handed weapons and are probably worth more than a living dark elf warrior to be honest.
