 Get a quick start to the game with impressive melee skills and starting with a weapon and iron working, while still having limited spells.
 Management of prisoners is important. You can use &quot;forbid zone&quot; and locked doors to stop them from entering an area.
 The only way for the dark knight to get more peasants is to enslave the locals.
 Normally there should be an abundance of low level enemies that you can enslave using just your keeper.
 It is possible to get stuck on a level with no peasants and no prisoners, so be careful.
 It happens mid-game sometimes, and you will have to fight your way back from this situation because you don't get any imps.
