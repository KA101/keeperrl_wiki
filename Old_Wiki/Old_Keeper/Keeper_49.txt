 Get a quick start to the game with impressive melee skills and starting with a weapon, while still having limited spells.
 The only way for the dark knight to get more peasants is to enslave the locals. Prisoners can't be directly controlled like workers.
 You can however, use &quot;forbid zone&quot; to stop them from entering an area.
 Normally there should be an abundance of low level enemies that you can enslave using just your keeper.
 It is possible to get stuck on a level with no peasants and no prisoners, so be careful. It happens mid-game sometimes.
