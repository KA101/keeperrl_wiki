==Modding tutorial for KeeperRL==
*The first recommendation is to get familiar with the existing modding system on KeeperRL
*There are two types of mod on KeeperRL
**Local mods (Edit the [[Official_Game_Configs | official game files]] locally) - Can't be uploaded onto the Web. Easier to learn for beginners.
**Web mods (Write new mod files that modify, replace or append to the official game files) - Slightly tougher but you can upload them for other players to use.
*Make some simple changes to the vanilla files, that is the official files (Try some of the suggestions below) and test the changes. Vanilla configs are found under &quot;KeeperRL\datafree\gamedata\*.txt&quot;
 Note, when changing vanilla configs you need to back them up in case you damage them
*After learning to do local mods, install some existing Web Mods
*Test them
*Start writing your own Web mods
