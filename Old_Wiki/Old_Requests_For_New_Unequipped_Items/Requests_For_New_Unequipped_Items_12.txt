=== Potion of garlic mixture ===
*Weight: 0.3
*Price: 50
*Type: Potion
*Thrown accuracy (potions only): 6
*Spell triggered: None
*Special Powers: Destroys vampires when thrown
* Concept: Vampires are a bit tough, but legend has it that they also have some definite weaknesses.
* Purpose in game: Nerf vampires a little bit.
* Optional features: Make damage not too high, so that vampires are still very powerful. Do not give the potions to enemy tribes.
* Discussion: Perhaps just lower stats, not destroy the vampire.
** Yeah, making an instakill potion, then not giving it to enemies sounds weird. Just make it debuff/frighten the vampire. They were after all repulsed by the scent of garlic, not killed by it, in fiction. --[[User:Red kangaroo|Red kangaroo]] ([[User talk:Red kangaroo|talk]]) 17:30, 28 February 2017 (CET)

=== Terrain seeing potion ===
*Weight: 0.3
*Price: 10000 mana
*Type: Potion
*Special Powers: Shows you the whole map when you drink it, with no areas left to explore. Campaigns need one potion per map tile.
* Concept: This could be something to spend mana on if you have a large excess at the end.
* Purpose in game: Exploration can be a bit dull at the end of the game and if you have earnt enough mana, why not?
* Optional features: Shows you items on the ground as well.
* Discussion: Maybe a scroll of magic mapping, as already suggested by someone below, instead?

=== Potion of Regeneration ===
* Weight: 0.3
* Price: 1000 gold, or 500 mana to create
* Special Powers: Drink to regrow one random lost limb.
* Concept: An expensive way to regain lost limbs.
* Purpose in game: It would be nice if there was a way to regain lost limbs, at a price.
* Optional features: Should be very rarely, if ever found in chests, to prevent easy recovery for adventurers. Finding and buying one in a shop is okay, though.

=== Scroll of trap destruction ===
*Weight: 0.5
*Price: 300
*Type: Scroll

*Discussion:

*Concept: Speed up research, if you can find one.

*Weight: 0.5
*Price: Must find

== Books ==
* Special Powers: Read (apply) to learn a new spell or skill. Consumable, so only usable once.
* Concept: Let's your minions learn skills and spells they otherwise couldn't, but at the cost of a rare consumable item. Also great for adventurers.
* Purpose in game: Gives the minions that could very well use magic, but cannot study it in library (doppelgangers, mostly) limited access to spells. Mostly useful for adventurers, though, as they would greatly benefit from being able to learn new skills and spells. There should be skill- and spellbooks for the various traits, for example:
** book of knife throwing (either grants knife throwing, or increases it by 10-30%)
** book of archery (either grants archery, or increases it by 10-30%)
** book of deception (grants deception spell)
** book of meteor shower
