== Summary ==
The duke is a powerful man with an awesome defensive ability and even better at dealing damage. If you can take him alive, you should. You need him in your dungeon and if you pull out his fancy finger nails or stretch his arms a bit on a torture table he might be just the guy you need.

Otherwise, yes he is a self righteous bigot and a big inconvenience standing in your way of gleefully trashing everything and everyone that doesn't understand your ambitions. You need to be a bit careful about how you handle him.
