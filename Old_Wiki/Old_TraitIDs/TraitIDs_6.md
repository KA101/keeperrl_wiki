=Usage=
Used to specify what traits immigrants have

=Example from immigration.txt=
From: [[Immigration.txt]]
 traits = { '''FIGHTER NO_AUTO_EQUIPMENT''' }

=Valid Values=
*LEADER
*FIGHTER
*WORKER
*PRISONER
*NO_EQUIPMENT
*NO_LIMIT
*FARM_ANIMAL
*SUMMONED
*NO_AUTO_EQUIPMENT
*DOESNT_TRIGGER
*INCREASE_POPULATION

=Explanation=
When modding the immigrant.txt file, majority of the above traits will be in use. Below there will be a (unfinished) list of what each trait does, and how it affects the game.

*LEADER: As of Alpha 27, this trait is not in the immigrant file.
 

*FIGHTER: This determines if your minions will actively fight (albeit there exists other means) hostile units. Note, FIGHTER excludes minions from digging/construction tasks. This explains why your dwarf fighter (slave) can unhappily mine in the dark, but instantly ignore mining tasks after being recruited via torturing.


*WORKER: The distinction between your imp and orc. Minions with this trait will not actively fight hostiles, perform construction/digging tasks, as well as odd tasks like torturing. Note, that WORKER excludes your minions from joining teams, however manual control is still available.


*PRISONER: As of Alpha 27, this trait is not in the immigrant file.


*NO_EQUIPMENT: This trait is often in combination with WORKER, as this is the reason your imps will not equip battle axes or shields. It is still functional to have this trait in addition to fighter, (see succubus}, though this leaves your minions in a dangerous position.


*NO_LIMIT: The reason you can recruit as many imps as there is gold, where as an orc is limited by your population cap. Typically given to worker minions, combining it with FIGHTER is still functional; thus one could add it to the orc, or any desired minion.


*FARM_ANIMAL: As of Alpha 27, this trait is not in the immigrant file.


*SUMMONED: As of Alpha 27, this trait is not in the immigrant file.


*NO_AUTO_EQUIPMENT:


*DOESNT_TRIGGER:


*INCREASE_POPULATION: A niche trait. As of Alpha 27, only found with the White Keeper immigrant group (specifically the livestock minion). The function of this is as expected, for the price of a single minion, the population cap is increased by 1. This of course is in combination with NO_LIMIT.


As stated, this is not a finished nor exhaustive look into the traits for the immigrant.txt file.
