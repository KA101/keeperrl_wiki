==No Armour==
*Purpose: Prevent wearing of armour by some creatures.
*Suggested creatures: Ogre, Harpy
*Reasoning: Ogre is too large, Harpy is odd-shaped.
*Discussion: 

I think the Harpy should have armor, but maybe not heavy armor [[User:Owen|Owen]] ([[User talk:Owen|talk]]) 01:11, 27 February 2017 (CET)

==No Two Handed==
*Purpose: Prevent wielding two handed
*Suggested creatures: Harpy
*Reasoning: Too heavy to wield for flying creature

==No Heavy Armour==
*Purpose: Prevent wearing metal armour
*Suggested creatures: Orc shaman and Vampires
*Reasoning: Not suitable for creatures that want to use magic

*Discussion: Would also suggest this for Orcs.  Orcs can used ranged and two-handed weapons and light armor; they shouldn't get to use everything.

==No ranged weapon==
*Purpose: Prevent use of ranged weapons
*Suggested creatures: Zombies
*Reasoning: They just aren't clever enough to do this

=Miscellaneous=

==Paralysis Immune==
*Purpose: This monster can't be stunned
*Suggested creatures: Elementals and automations
*Reasoning: These monsters are not biological, so do not get paralysed.

==Invisibile==
*Purpose: Get attacked by invisible monsters sometimes. Perhaps have a minion type like ghosts who can scout invisibly.
*Suggested creatures: New villain? How about ghosts, they are under powered at the moment?
*Reasoning: Some monsters are just invisible by nature
*Discussion: I'm afraid that in this state this would mostly cause a WTF reaction from the player and wouldn't add much meaningful gameplay.

==Telepathic==
*Purpose: Some monsters can still see you when you are invisible
*Suggested creatures: The elementalist might be telepathic
*Reasoning: Some creatures would be telepathic by nature and not need a telepathy helm.

== Pack Leader / Pack Member ==
*Purpose: Unit will gain global stat boost (maybe just morale) if its pack leader is present
*Suggested creatures: wolves, werewolves, other bestial units; humanoids can act as pack leaders
*Reasoning: rudimentary interaction between units

== Loner / Gregarious ==
*Purpose: Unit's morale will be severely hampered / boosted in the presence of allies (and vice versa)
*Suggested creatures: legendary humanoids
*Reasoning: forces player to use unit in team or alone

== Leader ==
*Purpose: Unit will only fight if it is allowed to be the leader of a team
*Suggested creatures: humanoids
*Reasoning: forces player to control team with certain unit

== Pass through walls ==
* Purpose: Can walk deep into rock and right through walls.
* Suggested creatures: Ghosts
* Reasoning: Buff Ghosts.

== No Sleep ==
* Purpose: The monster doesn't sleep and cannot be put to sleep
* Suggested creatures: Elementals. 
* Reasoning: Doesn't make sense. Was even able to put a boulder trap to sleep!

== Detector ==
* Purpose: The unit can always detect hidden or cloaked units that are in the Line of Sight of the detecting unit
* Suggested creatures: bats, ravens, and similar units that would be otherwise useless
* Reasoning: Give these weaker creatures some strategic value

== Heightened sense of smell (Hypernosmia) ==
* Purpose: The unit can detect the approximate location of traps or enemies from beyond visible range
* Suggested creatures: wolves, bears
* Reasoning: Give these weaker creatures some strategic value

== Agoraphobic / Claustrophobic ==
* Purpose: Unit performs worse in open areas / enclosed areas
* Suggested creatures: Any creature at random. (Including both minions and invaders?)
* Reasoning: Makes some creatures suck more in some situations
* Discussion : Sounds cool. Give them an equal and opposite buff in their preferred environment, so you are not tempted to drown them? (Keeperman).
* Discussion : Undead could be immune.
* Discussion : Enclosed areas could be anywhere in the dungeon. Open areas could be anywhere outside the dungeons.
* Discussion : Since we are building a dungeon, most minions would perform better in dungeons anyway (maybe except wolves)

== Rogue-like ==
* Purpose: Allow a creature to level up more on real fights (without training). So, also remove training task
* Suggested creatures: Certain legendary beasts and humanoids. Recruitable adventurers.
* Reasoning: Sometimes fun to play a rogue-like assault on dungeons during a game as keeper.

== Unabsorbable ==
* Purpose: Prevent dopplegangers from absorbing these (No Over-Powered dopples)
* Suggested creatures: Some rare additions to your dungeon (perhaps future creatures)
* Reasoning: Some creatures won't be absorbable (even if they join your dungeon)

== Water creature, Lava creature or Rock creature ==
* Purpose: Make some creatures natural to certain terrain. Hard to leave the water or lava or rock tiles. If they do, they will move very slowly.
* Suggested creatures: Sea monsters, lava monsters or bleeding stone
* Reasoning: Warfare in often inaccessible terrains. Terrain boarders such as lakesides. Very fast movement in their natural terrain.

== Trap immune ==
* Purpose: Never triggers traps. (Doesn't disarm them either, which is what the &quot;disarming&quot; skill does)
* Suggested creatures: Ghosts
* Reasoning: Ghosts and other creatures are not solid enough to trigger traps.

== No levelling ==
* Purpose: Minions that start at a decent level but cannot gain additional levels. Slightly different play style.
* Suggested creatures: Perhaps some rare, recruitable creaturess.
* Reasoning: Animated swords for example, would not gain combat experience by killing things.

== Inventory Recall ==
* Purpose: When a minion who has this trait dies, everything in its inventory gets magically transported back to equipment storage.
* Suggested creatures: Anything that can carry equipment could be capable of learning Inventory Recall.  (I.e., it could be learned by reading a scroll, having a spell cast on the unit, etc).
* Reasoning: It allows the player to treat some creatures as expendible


==Terrifying==
*Purpose: Some units should have this Trait, like Vamp lords or Ghosts or whatever
*Effect: Would give any near by enemy's (except Dragons) a slight Attack Defence, and accuracy debuff(say -5 Atk/Def/Acc) while the effecting unit is in the enemy's presence or until killed. the effect will last for 5 ticks after the effecting unit is killed or is otherwise dispersed in some way.
