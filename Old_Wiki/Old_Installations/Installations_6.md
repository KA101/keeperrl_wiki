=Structures=

==Soft rock==
*Fill in holes in your walls

==Hard rock==
*Make filled holes slightly harder to breakdown

==Reinforced wall==
*Increase efficiency of nearby training, crafting and studying

==Pit==
*Force invaders to bridge gaps or fly across them. Can be filled with water by digging channels from lakes and rivers to make a moat.

= Doors=
*Lock minions into areas or out of areas. Slow down advancing armies.
*Click on a built door to lock it.''

==Wooden door==
*Weak barrier

==Iron door ==
*Medium barrier

==Adamantium door==
*Strong barrier

== Bridge ==
''Build it to pass over water or lava.''
* Cost : 20 wood

Contrary to most constructions, a bridge cannot be destroyed by ordering it, [[:Fire Sphere|fire]], [[:Word of Power|word of power]]... In this regard, it is more like another piece of land.

== Barricade ==
''Place it on tiles next to a wall.''
* Cost : 20 wood
* Requires : [[:Technologies#Crafting|Crafting]]

Barricades let the air through, not your minions! Pretty useful to have a indoor pigsty without corpse rotting hazard. Best is to have a barricade &quot;window&quot; next to water (neighbors: they don't swim... or fly).

== Torch ==
''Place it on tiles next to a wall.''
* Cost : none
* Increases room efficiency
* Light emission : 8.2

== Eyeball ==
''Makes the area around it visible.''
* Cost : 10 mana
* Vision range : 30 Tiles

To get max range, it might be handy to add torches (and to cut or burn those annoying trees).

== Statue ==
''Augments the population cap by 1.''
* Cost: 300 gold

Less effective than the [[:Throne|throne]] but you can add as many statues as you want - the minions like fine art!

== Prisoner Head ==
''Impaled head of an executed prisoner. Aggravates enemies.''
* Cost : 1 [[:Prisoner#Tasks|prisoner head]]
* Each head increase the chance to be attacked by villages.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''As of [[:Category:Alpha15|alpha15]] prisoners tasked with execution seem to live on indefinitely. Bug or undocumented gameplay?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
