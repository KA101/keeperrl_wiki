==Summary==
A major boss with one weakness. His elementals return to the ether when you kill him. That tends to be a whole lot easier, so try killing him on the open battlefield. If you meet him in his tower, you may find a load of elemental spirits that need dealing with first.

This guy can be captured but doesn't learn any spells when you train him. To be frank the guy is not worth capturing alive and should just be killed. Still a major boss and can be painful when he attacks with his elementals.
