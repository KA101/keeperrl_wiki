Please fill out the structure below (Shown for giant recruits)

= Greenskins / Humanoids (Sleep in beds) =


==Necromage==
*Start level : 10
*Strength : 30
*Dexterity : 30
*Speed : 20
*Weight : light
*Size : small
*Unarmed attack bonus : 6
*Attack : 30
*Defence : 26
*Accuracy : 40
*Traits : Humanoid 
*Tasks: : Study, Training, Potions, Poison Immune (Raise dead)?
*Concept: More of a Front line mage, something better than Orc Shaman,  
*Purpose in game: Evil Human Necromancer to have a Decent front line magic user that can be recruited, No heals, No mana production.
*Optional features: Female to add a few more ladies to the ranks, Raise dead ability would be cool if it worked like summon flies but only when surrounded by corpses, Requirements could include having graves and/or a specific amount of undead. Balance to be the basic equal of a Vamp but can roam in the day time?
*Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

== Giant ==
* Start level : 15
* Strength : 30
* Dexterity : 5
* Speed : 50
* Weight : 5000
* Size : HUGE
* Unarmed attack bonus : 20
* Attack : 30
* Defence : 40
* Accuracy : 10
* Traits : Humanoid

* Concept: A huge monster that does nothing but eat and sleep. Good at combat but poor accuracy.
* Purpose in game: He is a good tank. High defense, if rather rubbish at hitting back on target.
* Optional features: Recruit one per map only. Not a tribe.
* Discussion: This could be difficult to pull off visually because all sprites take up the same space. It's already tricky to give mobs a sense of scale.

Could we call it a troll as per Brogue-lore and make it a legendary greenskin?  It would not be allowed to use ranged weapons, but it could carry heavy weaponry.  [[User:Owen|Owen]] ([[User talk:Owen|talk]]) 01:17, 27 February 2017 (CET)
