Please fill out the structure below (Shown for giant recruits)

== Giant ==
* Start level : 15
* Strength : 30
* Dexterity : 5

* Concept: A huge monster that does nothing but eat and sleep. Good at combat but poor accuracy.
* Purpose in game: He is a good tank. High defense, if rather rubbish at hitting back on target.
* Optional features: Recruit one per map only. Not a tribe.
* Discussion: This could be difficult to pull off visually because all sprites take up the same space. It's already tricky to give mobs a sense of scale.

Could we call it a troll as per Brogue-lore and make it a legendary greenskin?  It would not be allowed to use ranged weapons, but it could carry heavy weaponry.  [[User:Owen|Owen]] ([[User talk:Owen|talk]]) 01:17, 27 February 2017 (CET)
