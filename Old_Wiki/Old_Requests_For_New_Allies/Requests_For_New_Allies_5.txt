Please fill out the structure below (Shown for giant recruits)

== Giant ==
* Start level : 15

* Weight : 5000
* Size : HUGE
* Unarmed attack bonus : 20
* Attack : 30
* Defence : 40
* Accuracy : 10
* Traits : Humanoid
* Tasks: Sleep, Eat
* Concept: A huge monster that does nothing but eat and sleep. Good at combat but poor accuracy.
* Purpose in game: He is a good tank. High defense, if rather rubbish at hitting back on target.
* Optional features: Recruit one per map only. Not a tribe.
* Discussion: This could be difficult to pull off visually because all sprites take up the same space. It's already tricky to give mobs a sense of scale.
