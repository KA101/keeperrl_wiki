Some potions and a good book and his day is complete.

==Summary==

Basic spell caster minion that you can recruit early on. A good choice of healer for your teams. Later on they learn more advanced spells and can occasionally get excited and set alight to your library, or perhaps worse - set alight to the forest near your dungeon base, giving you a wood shortage.
