==Summary==

They live in mountains, often near resources. They tend to leave the fighting to their ant warrior brothers. They are cowardly but ugly giant creatures that can do a bit of damage if cornered. It is a shame that you cannot just boil a kettle and pour the bubbling water down their hole.
