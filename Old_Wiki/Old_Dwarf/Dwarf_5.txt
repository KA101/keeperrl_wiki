== Summary ==
Sturdy opponents not to be underestimated early in the game. You need to get used to the idea that a dwarf wielding a battle axe with armour, boots and helmet really can wipe the floor with a small party of fully armed orcs. You will need something stronger to deal with them, so don't go running in and steal their stuff straight away.
