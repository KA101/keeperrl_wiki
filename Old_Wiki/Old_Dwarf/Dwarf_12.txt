== Summary ==
You don't have to be tall to be dangerous. Shorter but stout cousins to the human race. Sturdy opponents not to be underestimated early in the game.

You need to get used to the idea that a dwarf wielding a battle axe with armour, boots and helmet really can wipe the floor with a small party of fully armed orcs. You will need something stronger to deal with them, so don't go running in and steal their stuff straight away. Dwarves are also expert diggers and will dig into your dungeon when provoked making them more dangerous if you do not take the fight to them first. For this reason, avoid triggering them by staying away from the green &quot;?&quot; symbols in the mountains until you recruit and train a band of ogres and make yourself iron armor.

Dwarves can be looted for some decent early game armor but also make excellent prisoner miners. They are numerous creatures with small settlements dotted about in a lot of places. You can build some nice prisons for them and they may resolve your mining requirements for the rest of the game.
