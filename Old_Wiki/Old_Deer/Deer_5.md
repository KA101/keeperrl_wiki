==Summary==
Fun to shoot down with a bow, if you can find them. They are a lot easier to spot from the air. Not a danger unless you blunder into one without any armour on. Imps don't like them much.

Deer are naturally occurring wildlife that tend to be nervous and somewhat distant from dungeons and other settlements.
