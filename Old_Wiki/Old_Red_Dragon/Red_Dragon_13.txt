==Summary==
Armed with dangerous spells and the capacity to breathe fire and heal, these great dragons are perhaps best tackled on the open battlefield outside your dungeon, where the strength in numbers is felt most. Try not to let them enter your base and set everything on fire.

Killing this creature is not trivial but a strong arrow to the belly has been known to bring them down. It is worth trying with driads and elven archers.

Red dragons tend to live on their own so, surrounding them out in the open is possible. This is a creature that is often best attacked rather than letting them turn up at your dungeon unannounced.
