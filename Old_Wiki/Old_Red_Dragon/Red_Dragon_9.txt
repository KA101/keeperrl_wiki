==Summary==
Armed with dangerous spells and the capacity to breathe fire, these great dragons are perhaps best tackled on the open battlefield outside your dungeon, where the strength in numbers is felt most. Try not to let them enter your base and set everything on fire. Killing this creature is not trivial but a strong arrow to the belly has been known to bring them down.
