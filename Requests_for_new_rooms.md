    different mushrooms)
-   Minion tasks: Eating
-   Technology: Mushroom farming
-   Spawning: Mushrooms (not pigs)
-   Spawn rate: Slow
-   Special effects: +1 population\*
-   Concept: What is the basic concept behind this?
-   Purpose in game: What makes this thing unique?
-   Optional features: Minions could go there to eat mushrooms and get
    the effects of those mushrooms by eating them.
-   Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

Medical Room
------------

-   Cost per tile: 15 iron and/or Stone
-   Attracts minions: None, can be worked by Orc shamans only.
-   Production queue: A better more fitting place to create Medkits.
-   Production queue: Attachable arm, attachable leg etc. Costings lost
    limbs (eg. orc arm etc.)
-   Production queue: Attachable limbs might work best as a new
    consumable, which can be applied to recover the limb.

-   Technology: Medicine (New technology costing lots of mana)
-   Spawning: Medkits (Instead of workshop).

    Same as existing workshop for Medkits.
-   Special effects: Minions that are wounded or have lost limbs can get
    attachable limbs here (if the limb is an arm and is reattached to an
    orc that lost an arm and is still fresh and not completely rotted,
    this would take some time)
-   Special effects and/or magically regrow limbs for a small sum of
    mana say 100 per limb.
-   Concept: Instead of just disarming them and then drowning them just
    send them here and NOT lose your lvl 56 Vampire lord. &gt;:\[
-   Purpose in game: Minions that lose limbs become all but useless. Now
    you can have them back in your army.
-   Optional features: Make Medkits, Reattach limbs for time and mana
    (and a supply of freshly lost limbs).
-   Optional features: Imps carry all lost limbs to the medical room
    instead of the graveyard. Imps still carry corpses to the graveyard.
-   Discussion: Keeperman 22/02/2017. Rearranged the wording to clarify.
    Tried to keep the whole idea the way it was intended. (added a bit)
