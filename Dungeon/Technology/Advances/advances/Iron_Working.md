-Early on you meet dwarves that usually have 2 handed iron weapons, so match their weaponry. You need iron-working and 2-handed weapon technologies. Iron working will get you the ability to build iron training dummies, so make sure you have trained up ogres to wield the weapons. 
-You also need this to go the adamantium route. The golems will need dealing with before you can max out training with the best training equipment and get the best weapons and armours.
-You can go the werewolf route. Regeneration and stealth with decent training and weapons. Hit and run.
