-Take heal potions, slow down potions to throw, speed up potions to drink, melee resistance potions to drink, melee vulnerability potions to throw. Kit up on alchemy and mushrooms. This is the consumables route and if you want to do it, research the alchemy tree. The disadvantage is it costs you gold.
