It is possible to build separate prisons and torture rooms but I tend to
build them together for convenience.

Prison cells
------------

To acquire prisoners, right click on humanoid enemies when fighting in a
team and select “Order Capture”. Make sure you have enough space in your
prison for your prisoners (the first 4 prisoners are “free” but after
that you need prison tiles).

-   15 iron cost per prison tile

Torture tables
--------------

-   The Torture tables are where you torture your prisoners, and may be
    able to convert them. The survival rate is about 50%.
-   20 iron cost
