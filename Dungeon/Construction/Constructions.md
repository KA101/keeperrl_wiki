To manage your dungeon, you can ask your workers and recruited volunteers (prisoners) to construct rooms, install features and set traps. The exact options that will be available to you will depend on your faction and upon what technologies and resources you have available.


Structures:

In dungeons, walls can be reinforced with stone to help stop enemies from digging in. Archer walls can be used to build outdoor walls with arrows lits for added defense and the ability for skilled archers to shoot at enemies. Filling space with soft rock is cheaper to build. Hard mountain stone fills in an empty tile more firmly. When building interior structures, the floors can be made using a variety of materials such as wood, stone, or gold carpet. For outdoor structures, wooden walls and pillars can be used to create particular look and feel. Stone walls can be used to build a castle or fortress for added defense and a grander appearance, while castle pillars can be used to create decorative features. Bridges can be built over water or gaps using wood or stone, but caution must be taken not to build wood over lava. Stairs can be used to access higher or lower levels of a building or dungeon. To create a defensive structure or trap for enemies, a pit can be dug in the ground using pit stone. Stone can be used to fill up a parts of water or lava for a decorative pool or to create obstacles for enemies.


Doors:

To try and stop enemies from entering a building, wooden, iron, or adamantine doors and gates can be used. Wooden doors, iron doors and adamantium doors provide different levels of resitance to being bashed down.


Storage:

The storage resources zone is designed to store specific resources, such as wood, iron, granite, and adamantium. These resources can be used for building structures or other purposes. The storage equipment zone, on the other hand, is intended for storing all the equipment that your minions may need, including weapons, armor, and other tools. The treasure chest is a wooden chest designed specifically for storing all your gold. It is a safe to leave your gold. The armor rack and weapon rack are wooden racks where you can store all your armor and weapons, respectively. The bow rack is designed to store your ranged weapons. The scroll storage and potion storage are wooden shelves where you can store your scrolls and potions, respectively. These shelves provide an organized and easily accessible way to store your magical items. The jewelry storage is a wooden chest where you can store all your jewelry. It is a place to keep your valuable and precious items. The grave stone is a storage option for storing corpses. It is an organized way to store the remains of your fallen enemies. The automaton storage is a wooden chest designed specifically for storing all your automaton parts. This is a safe and secure place to keep your valuable resources for your mechanical minions.


Training:

There are several options available for training minions in combat skills. The wooden dummy training option provides an opportunity to train melee skills, while the iron and adamantine dummy training options allow for more advanced training but need iron working and materials. The archery range provides an opportunity for minions to train their archery skills with archery targets. The wooden bookcase can be used to train minions' magical powers in sorcery. The Iron bookcase is used for advanced sorcery training. The Golden bookcase is reserved for the master sorcery training of minions.
 

Quarters:

Leisure Zones designate an area where minions can relax and socialize when they have nothing to do. Guard Zones designate an area that minions will actively guard. A Quarters zone designates separate quarters for chosen minions. The basic bed is made of wood and is used for humanoid minions to sleep. The fine bed is made of iron and provides a more upscale sleeping option. The luxurious bed is made of gold and is the most extravagant and comfortable bed available for humanoid minions. There are three different types of coffins for undead creatures, with increasing levels of luxury: basic coffin made of wood, fine coffin made of stone, and luxurious coffin made of gold. The wooden dining table is where humanoid minions can eat their meals. The haypile is a place for non-humanoid creatures to eat.

 
Farming:

The farming options include a wooden chicken coop for breeding chickens, a pigsty for breeding pigs, and a cow pen for breeding cows. An animal fence is also needed to prevent farm animals from escaping.

 
Crafting:

Crafting options include a workshop for producing leather equipment, traps, and first-aid kits; a forge for making metal weapons and armor; a laboratory for crafting magical potions and body balsams; a jeweler for creating magical rings and amulets; a poetry table for writing poems; a distillery for making moonshine; a morgue table for producing animated bodies; and a furnace for smelting and recycling unneeded items. Additionally, there are options for automatons, including wooden, iron, and adamantine engines.


Prisons:

There are several options for building a prison. The iron prison is required to capture enemies, while the iron prison bars and door can be used to secure the prison. The iron torture table can be used to torture prisoners, but a free population slot is required for this. The wood gallows is for hanging prisoners, and the wood beast cage is where beasts can sleep. 


Installations:

These are the different types of installations that can be built: barricade for blocking enemy movement, torches and candelabra for lighting, standing torch for ground lighting, painting canvas for decoration, message board for leaving messages, fountain for aesthetics, whipping post for disciplining minions, impaled prisoner head to aggravate enemies, statues for increasing population limits, magical installations such as eyeballs for visibility and portal for travel, and healing and bleeding totems for healing or damaging nearby characters. 

Traps:

In building traps for your dungeon, you have a variety of options to choose from. You could opt for the Terror Trap, which induces panic in the trespasser, or the Poison Gas Trap, which releases a cloud of poisonous gas. The Alarm Trap summons all your minions to deal with the invader, while the Web Trap immobilizes them for a time. The Surprise Trap teleports nearby minions to deal with the trespasser, while the Fire Trap causes a tower of flame to erupt under them. You could also choose the Boulder Trap, which sends a huge boulder rolling towards the enemy, or the Blast Trap, which creates an air blast that throws them across a few tiles. If you prefer a more advanced option, the Gnome Traps provide the Trap Trigger, which triggers all other traps around it, and the Destroy Walls Trap, which destroys all walls up to two tiles away. Whatever your preference, there are plenty of options to choose from when building traps for your dungeon.


Power up options:

The Throne, Phylactery, Demon Shrine, and Angel Shrine are all building options that can be used to power up your dungeon in different ways. The Throne costs gold and you can only build one but it increases your population limit, while the Phylactery costs gold and allows you to free your soul from your body. The Demon Shrine costs gold and allows you to summon demons and other wicked spirits using demonology, while the Angel Shrine costs gold and allows you to summon angels and other kind spirits using worship.
