Structures
==========

Soft rock
---------

-   Fill in holes in your walls

Hard rock
---------

-   Make filled holes slightly harder to breakdown

Reinforced wall
---------------

-   Increase efficiency of nearby training, crafting and studying

Pit
---

-   Force invaders to bridge gaps or fly across them. Can be filled with
    water by digging channels from lakes and rivers to make a moat.

Bridge
------

*Build it to pass over water or lava.*

-   Cost : 20 wood

-   Click on a built door to lock it.''

Wooden door
-----------

-   Weak barrier

Installations
=============

Barricade
---------

*Place it on tiles next to a wall.*

-   Cost : 20 wood
-   Requires : [Crafting](/keeperrl_wiki/Crafting "wikilink")

Barricades let the air through, not your minions! Pretty useful to have
a indoor pigsty without corpse rotting hazard. Best is to have a
barricade “window” next to water (neighbors: they don't swim... or fly).

Torch
-----

*Place it on tiles next to a wall.*

-   Cost : none
-   Increases room efficiency
-   Light emission : 8.2

Standing Torch
--------------

-   Like a normal torch but placed on the floor not a wall

Message board
-------------

-   Other members of the KeeperRL community can post on your dungeon
    message board

Eyeball
-------

*Makes the area around it visible.*

-   Cost : 10 mana
-   Vision range : 30 Tiles

To get max range, it might be handy to add torches (and to cut or burn
those annoying trees).

Portal
------

Gold Statue
-----------

-   Less effective than the [throne](/keeperrl_wiki/Throne "wikilink") but you can add
    as many statues as you want - the minions like fine art!
-   Augments the population cap by 1.''
-   Cost: 50 gold

Stone Statue
------------

-   Augments the population cap by 1.per statue.
-   Cost: 250 Stone
-   Maximum population of +4 from stone statues

Whipping Post
-------------

-   If they don't look happy enough, they just need to be “educated” a
    bit.

Gallows
-------

-   A place to execute prisoners that look nicer as a head on a pole.

Prisoner Head
-------------

*Impaled head of an executed prisoner. Aggravates enemies.*

-   Cost : 1 [prisoner head](/keeperrl_wiki/Tasks "wikilink")
-   Each head increase the chance to be attacked by villages.
