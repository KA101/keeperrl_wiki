- Weight: 0.3
- Price: 5
- Type: Potion
- Thrown accuracy (potions only): 40
- Special Powers: Causes whoever uses the potion to have hallucinations for about 30 turns.
- Concept: A more powerful &quot;magic mushroom&quot; that can be thrown.
- Purpose in game: Can be thrown at enemies to make them hallucinate, and maybe they can see you as a red dragon during their hallucination, and run away from you, or see you as a weak rat and chase you down, even if you are stronger than them.
- Optional Features: If thrown at another creature, randomly decrease their morale so they run away from you, or increase their morale.
- Discussion: Discuss the idea here.
