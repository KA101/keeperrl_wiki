- Weight: 0.3
- Defence : 0
- Price: 1000+G
- Type: Ring or Amulet (there can be only one!)
- Special Powers: The Minion that has this item equipped and this minion alone can find extra gold on killed minions/enemies or lying on the floor, A chance a trap won't activate upon walking on it. Better chance to find rare and powerful weapons/armor/scrolls. so if you find nice looking piles of gold and loot send the Lucky minion in and see whats there. if you send in a normal minion, and see the loot, That is what you will get. RNG kind of thing.
- Concept: Lots of RPG's have a ring/Necklace like this.
- Purpose in game: Gives you a lucky edge and full pockets (of Gold that is).
- Craftable: No
- Discussion: Discuss the idea here. &lt;-Wot E sed :l
