-Tile Cost: 20 Iron

The Forge is an essential part of any successful dungeon.  Click on constructed Forge tiles to bring up the crafting menu; greyed-out items require additional technology
before you can build them.

As with all crafting stations, up to 8 creatures can contribute to projects at any particular Forge tile, and workers can collaborate on projects
between Forge tiles at different locations.

In KeeperRL 1.0, a Magma Forge is also available.  When built adjacent to magma, it uses this powerful and steady supply of heat to allow workers to craft gear with 40% better stats than that at the baseline Forge.

*Skilled Crafting*

In KeeperRL 1.0, crafters require skill 50 to work on adamantine objects.  While most crafters available to starting Keepers through Immigration are not to that standard, there are several ways to develop or obtain the necessary talent.

  - Insanity: Insane artificers are occasionally available through Immigration.  Though they require secured living & working space to avoid fighting with and being killed by the general population, the +20 Forge they receive will let them make adamantine gear.
  - Capture (and Conversion?): As you progress farther away from your base, you will find the folks you encounter have significantly higher skills; this is a function of the "difficulty curve" or "difficulty adjustment" seen in the world-generation diffciculty options.  While this generally makes faraway creatures tougher fighters, this adjustment also applies to their crafting skills.  Dwarves far enough away from the base will have 50 or more Forge, and can craft slowly as Prisoners or, if converted and given proper Quarters, can be geared with Fast Crafting.
  - Grinding: Since combat XP also boosts crafting skills, you could grind your artificers' combat levels.  This would be a challenge.  But challenges can be fun.  ;-)
  - Hiring: Given enough exploration, you may find an Ally blacksmith in your travels.  The smith you hire there has base 50 Forge, and depending on the difficulty adjustment, quite possibly more.

Adoxium and Infernite crafting require the even higher level of 80 Forge from crafters seeking to work them.  Capture, grinding, and hiring remain valid approaches.

Conversely, any crafter capable of working the basic material may add glyphs or craft items of creature bodyparts.
