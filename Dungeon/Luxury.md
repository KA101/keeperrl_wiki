Luxury
------

While the term "dungeon" may lead one to think of a damp, smelly, and generally unpleasant place to live, experienced Keepers know that there are better uses for gold than piling up in your chest.
With trifling applications of gold, and perhaps stone, in the right places, why, your reputable establishment can be made remarkably comfortable and pleasant for you and your minions.  And let's face it, what profit is it to gain the world but be stuck in a damp, smelly, unpleasant hole? 

Thus: Luxury.

Luxury is a numeric value contributed by pleasant (or perhaps just extravagant) dungeon architecture and fittings, such as fountains, well-fitted wooden, granite, or carpeted flooring, golden statues, candelabra, etc.
It has two primary functions in KeeperRL 1.0:

  1) Luxury immediately around a crafting (and perhaps training) station speeds work at that station: each work-bump becomes more efficient, up to 2x efficiency with carpeting, candles, and reinforced walls all nearby. More realistically, 1.2-1.7 efficiency can be had with stone flooring and candles in a more open setting.
  
  2) The more common use for Luxury is to compensate veteran minions by giving them luxurious quarters: a living space where you have gone to some expense to make them comfortable.  For example, a 1x4 "cell" (including a door with carpet underneath) with carpet, luxurious bed, fountain, and candles, all enclosed with a fortified stone wall, will satisfy a level 10-14 creature's Luxury requirement.
