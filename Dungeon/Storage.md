Treasure Chest
==============

-   Holds your gold
-   Each chest can hold unlimited gold pieces, so multiple chests are
    able to spread the gold into different locations or just provide
    decoration.
-   Treasure chests are built from the storage menu.

Tile Cost
---------

''5 wood per treasure chest

Usage
-----

Treasure chests empty as gold is used:

-   Building statues, carpets, demonshrines.
-   Recruitment of special units
-   Creatures in older versions of KeeperRL used to require salaries,
    but this is no longer the case.

Other storage
=============

There are currently 2 types of storage tiles: *material*, which store
[resources](/keeperrl_wiki/Resources "wikilink"), *equipment* which store
[items](/keeperrl_wiki/Items_Guide "wikilink")

Storage tiles are free to build and have no upper limit.

The [graveyard](/keeperrl_wiki/Graveyard "wikilink") stockpile
------------------------------------------------

While it certainly is the resting place of many of our
[undead](/keeperrl_wiki/Undead "wikilink") friends, it is also a the stockpile
for corpses, which means you should always have free tile for the lovely
bones.

Tips
----

There seems to be no upper limit to what a tile can store, which means
that 1 tile of *everything* can virtually hold... everything.

You can use this trick for a single [graveyard](/keeperrl_wiki/Graveyard "wikilink")
tile, provided you are ready to see your graveyard disappear if you have
room in your population cap and a zombie feels like joining.
Alternatively you can always have 2, and make it grow with every joiner
without risking a rotting accident in your keep.
