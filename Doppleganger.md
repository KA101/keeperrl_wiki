Summary
-------

This creature is famous for its ability to absorb other dungeon
inhabitants and so doing, gain many of their characteristics and skills.
They start of fairly weak but power up as they absorb other prisoners
and minions. Try not to absorb things with negative characteristics
since the likely outcome is that your doppleganger will exhibit those
traits as well.
