Potions
=======

### Potion of garlic mixture

-   Weight: 0.3
-   Price: 50
-   Type: Potion
-   Thrown accuracy (potions only): 6
-   Spell triggered: None
-   Special Powers: Destroys vampires when thrown
-   Concept: Vampires are a bit tough, but legend has it that they also
    have some definite weaknesses.
-   Purpose in game: Nerf vampires a little bit.
-   Optional features: Make damage not too high, so that vampires are
    still very powerful. Do not give the potions to enemy tribes.
-   Discussion: Perhaps just lower stats, not destroy the vampire.
    -   Yeah, making an instakill potion, then not giving it to enemies
        sounds weird. Just make it debuff/frighten the vampire. They
        were after all repulsed by the scent of garlic, not killed by
        it, in fiction. --[Red kangaroo](/wiki/User%3ARed_kangaroo "wikilink")

### Terrain seeing potion

-   Weight: 0.3
-   Price: 10000 mana
-   Type: Potion
-   Special Powers: Shows you the whole map when you drink it, with no
    areas left to explore. Campaigns need one potion per map tile.
-   Concept: This could be something to spend mana on if you have a
    large excess at the end.
-   Purpose in game: Exploration can be a bit dull at the end of the
    game and if you have earnt enough mana, why not?
-   Optional features: Shows you items on the ground as well.
-   Discussion: Maybe a scroll of magic mapping, as already suggested by
    someone below, instead?

### Potion of Regeneration (Implemented as artefact in Alpha 23)

-   Weight: 0.3
-   Price: 1000 gold, or 500 mana to create
-   Special Powers: Drink to regrow one random lost limb.
-   Concept: An expensive way to regain lost limbs.
-   Purpose in game: It would be nice if there was a way to regain lost
    limbs, at a price.
-   Optional features: Should be very rarely, if ever found in chests,
    to prevent easy recovery for adventurers. Finding and buying one in
    a shop is okay, though.

### Potion of Hallucination

-   Weight: 0.3
-   Price: 5
-   Type: Potion
-   Thrown accuracy (potions only): 40
-   Special Powers: Causes whoever uses the potion to have
    hallucinations for about 30 turns.
-   Concept: A more powerful “magic mushroom” that can be thrown.
-   Purpose in game: Can be thrown at enemies to make them hallucinate,
    and maybe they can see you as a red dragon during their
    hallucination, and run away from you, or see you as a weak rat and
    chase you down, even if you are stronger than them.
-   Optional Features: If thrown at another creature, randomly decrease
    their morale so they run away from you, or increase their morale.
-   Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

Scrolls
=======

### Scroll of Fire Ball

-   Weight: 0.5
-   Price: 25
-   Type: Scroll
-   Special Powers: When used, the caster can shoot one orb of fire in
    any direction. If it hits any wooden surface, or a tree or a bush,
    it will catch on fire. If it hits a creature, they will catch on
    fire for some turns.
-   Concept: Offensive scroll.
-   Purpose in game: Good in adventure mode, where you can't use spells.
    This is more of a support scroll now that I think of it. I guess it
    gets two uses, one in adventure mode, where you use this to defeat
    enemies, and one in keeper mode, where if you find this scroll in
    the early game you can use it to set houses on fire, meaning you can
    set elves houses on fire or their trees, giving you an advantage in
    this situation.
-   Optional features: Orb could come to life if it doesn't hit anything
    when cast.
-   Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

### Scroll of mapping

-   Weight: 0.5
-   Price: 100
-   Type: Scroll
-   Special Powers: Reveals the whole map surrounding the caster with a
    diameter of 50 squares, as if the keeper had visited the area
-   Concept: See what lies beyond.
-   Purpose in game: Decent for strategic play.
-   Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

### Scroll of trap destruction

-   Weight: 0.5
-   Price: 300
-   Type: Scroll
-   Special Powers: Destroys nearby traps
-   Concept: Rare item, but useful.
-   Purpose in game: Sometimes you know the trap is there, you just want
    to destroy it.
-   Discussion: Discuss the idea here.

### Scroll of blinding darkness

-   Weight: 0.5
-   Price: 200 gold
-   Type: Scroll
-   Special powers: Blinds all nearby creatures temporarily.
-   Concept: Rare scroll. Quite useful.
-   Purpose: Combat
-   Discussion:

### Scroll of knowledge

-   Weight: 0.5
-   Price: Must find in the game. Cannot buy.
-   Type: Scroll
-   Special Powers: grants one free technology from the technology tree.
    Always one you don't have already.
-   Concept: Speed up research, if you can find one.
-   Purpose in game: Replace the existing technology books, which rarely
    give you anything you don't yet have.
-   Optional features: Remove from the map while retiring dungeon. These
    should no be for stockpiling.
-   Discussion: (If you read it and you have all technologies unlocked,
    you will get a message saying “Nothing happened”, and if you read
    this as an adventurer, you will get the message “You become
    smarter”, but nothing happens as well -*Amazed*)

### Scroll of Blinking

-   Weight: 0.5
-   Price: Must find
-   Type: Scroll
-   Special Powers: Creates an anchor point at the tile where it is read
    and gives the reader a one-time blink spell that lasts for 50 turns.
    If the blink spell is activated, then the creature returns to the
    anchor point.
-   Purpose in game: Can be used to activate and then run from traps.
-   Discussion:

Mushrooms
=========

Make all the mushrooms useful, but double-edged, rather then making some
straight useless. This would both make it worthwhile to find and carry
all mushrooms, not just of strength and dexterity, and give the players
some nice decisions when to use the double-edged ones. Good example
already in game would be rage mushroom - giving you attack while
decreasing defense. -- [Red kangaroo](/wiki/User%3ARed_kangaroo "wikilink")

### Magic Mushroom

Still causes hallucination, but also grants see invisible - very useful
when you know there is an invisible enemy around, but can't find him,
but carries a risk when used with many enemies around. Hallucinatory
mushrooms were after all used by shamans to see the spirits, so you
should be able to do so, too. :D

### Panic Mushroom

Should cause fear and boost speed - great for running away!

### Forest Mushroom

Grants temporary elf vision.

Books
-----

-   Special Powers: Read (apply) to learn a new spell or skill.
    Consumable, so only usable once.
-   Concept: Let's your minions learn skills and spells they otherwise
    couldn't, but at the cost of a rare consumable item. Also great for
    adventurers.
-   Purpose in game: Gives the minions that could very well use magic,
    but cannot study it in library (doppelgangers, mostly) limited
    access to spells. Mostly useful for adventurers, though, as they
    would greatly benefit from being able to learn new skills and
    spells. There should be skill- and spellbooks for the various
    traits, for example:
    -   book of knife throwing (either grants knife throwing, or
        increases it by 10-30%)
    -   book of archery (either grants archery, or increases it by
        10-30%)
    -   book of deception (grants deception spell)
    -   book of meteor shower
