Summary
=======

Green dragons are sisters of the mighty red dragons. Although they do
not breathe fire, they are extremely toxic and also resist poison
attacks. Furthermore, they know spells. Perhaps the best remedy for
their stench is an arrow to the heart. Worth a try if you are struggling
with one of these great beasts.
