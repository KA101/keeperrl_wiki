# keeperrl_wiki

The KeeperRL wiki is recompiled from this repository.
The wiki is found at www.keeperRL.com/wiki
The main reason for failing to compile the wiki is errors.
Sometimes the wiki doesn't update if you do too many pages at once.
In that case, back out your changes and commit them in smaller chunks.
