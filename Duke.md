Summary
-------

The duke is a powerful man with an awesome defensive ability and even
better at dealing damage. If you can take him alive, you should. You
need him in your dungeon and if you pull out his fancy finger nails or
stretch his arms a bit on a torture table he might be just the guy you
need.
