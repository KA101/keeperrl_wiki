Q: Why does my save file keep getting bigger the longer I play for?
===================================================================

-   A: The number of entities in the game tends to go up. For example,
    new monsters migrate into the game with their equipment. When they
    die they leave equipment, corpses (and bytes) behind. This is
    perfectly normal and nothing to worry about.

Q: Are the ideas, requests and contributions found [in the ideas section](/keeperrl_wiki/Player_Ideas,_Requests_And_Contributions "wikilink") actually in the game?
====================================================================================================================================================

-   A:Most of them are not. Some of them however, have been used. Others
    are planned. Those not used are often still very helpful ideas.

Q: Are there any mods for this game?
====================================

-   A: Yes, the source code is open, so feel free to mod it as much as
    you like. There is a significant modding community at the Steam Workshop page:
    https://steamcommunity.com/app/329970/workshop/
    as well as a Git repository for folks who aren't using Steam:
    https://github.com/SoftMonster/KeeperRLCommunityResources

Q: When I died, the stats showed over 100 heads were chopped during the game. This is untrue.
=============================================================================================

-   A: Are you including pigs that have been slaughtered?

Q: How do I beat monster X or Y?
================================

-   A: Look up [ the full list of
    creatures](/keeperrl_wiki/Creatures_Guide "wikilink") for help.

Q: Is there a guard room or a guard post command?
=================================================

-   A: Yes.  You can have up to three different sets of guard posts, and assign creatures to staff the posts.
That said, guards can also have other tasks and needs, so it's best to have more guards than guard-post tiles.
Further, guards using ranged AI sometimes will retreat if enemies get too close, so keep that in mind!

Q: Can you build bridges when controlling a minion?
===================================================

-   A: No. You can order bridges built when not in control of a minion, but even controlling a unit that "builds bridges" as an ability, you cannot generate a bridge.
    You can get across water by wading through if you're Large or Huge and the water is Shallow, by riding a steed that's Large or Huge, by using Swimming skill, 
    or by levitating or flying; potions and jewelry may help.
    Monsters that are blocked by water and controlled by the AI may build bridges, so they don't get permanently stuck or become helpless targets for ranged attacks.

Q: Are there z-layers (can you dig up and down?)
================================================

-   A: Very much so! You can mine and build up and down, and build stairways where you like.  Mining down is the way to find higher-tier resources and noteworthy
underground structures, tribes, etc.; there is usually something or someone Interesting at the top of your home map.

Q: Is there a translation into my native language?
==================================================

-   A: No, not normally. However, sometimes there exist video streams
    explaining the game in a particular language.

Q: Did you know that there is this other game that stole the KeeperRL graphics?
===============================================================================

-   A: Some of the graphics have non-exclusive licenses. The other games
    most likely have the right to use those graphics as well. The stock
    graphics are being redrawn and mostly the graphics are now unique.

Q: Why did one of my minions attack the others?
===============================================

-   A: He may have been an insane minion. Those have to be managed very
    carefully. Don't recruit them if you don't want to spend time
    looking after them.

Q: Are there any achievements on Steam?
=======================================

-   A: No, not yet. This has been planned.

Q: When is KeeperRL going to come out of Alpha and be officially released?
==========================================================================

-   A: The game is getting better and better every release. So not
    expected until later.
