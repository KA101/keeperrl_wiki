Inter-campaign interactions
----

Some roguelike games include death and other failure-states as part of the larger game design, expecting that individual playthroughs may end in failure, and allowing players to derive some benefit from the effort involved in a "failed" run.
KeeperRL does not, unfortunately, provide a game-mechanical reward as such for individual campaigns, whether defeated or successful.
Nevertheless, there are ways in which runs that do not win the game can still improve the game for future runs, aside from the "you, as the player, learn from the failure and avoid it in the future" roguelike learning process.

1) Unlockable player factions
There are three player factions which start out locked, but can be unlocked and made accessible through actions taken in-game.  If you unlock a faction but your campaign later fails, the faction will remain unlocked and available for use.
(If you don't like the idea of locked content--some people don't, and that's OK--there's an option-menu toggle to override the locks and make everything accessible.)

2) "Bones" files
Dungeons that experience some success, but are ultimately conquered, are sometimes preserved and re-used by KeeperRL as a base map for other factions.  It's possible for you to encounter your previously defeated dungeon when sending out an away mission to some other faction.
(This writer has not personally experienced a Bones level of this sort, however; typically if he loses it's early enough that there isn't a dungeon to be reused.)

Retired Dungeons
--
While there is no overarching "Keeper Level" or other in-game benefit that accumulates between games of KeeperRL, successful Keeper campaigns can provide some amount of carryover benefit for future playthroughs, once they've dominated their world-map by defeating all major villains and then been duly Retired.

Retiring a dungeon saves it as a more or less static site, which you can then import into future campaigns as a separate class of Villain. (If you're a steam user, you've probably seen countless steam-workshop items named something like "So-and-so of Realm".  Those are retired dungeons! When you retire a dungeon and are connected to steam, yours will show up in the workshop too.)
There's no numerical restriction on how difficult your dungeon must be to be re-used, but retired dungeons are buffed to +50 combat XP and generally placed away from the starting location.  Monty-Haul style "retired dungeon full of loot to be salvaged" setups are not a guaranteed instant-win, but the possibility of creating a "booster" dungeon still remains.
Conversely, importing a super-powerful dungeon would give you the opportunity to capture its creatures and loot its equipment and resources, if you could overcome its defenses...
But if it turns out that the retired dungeon is too powerful for you to conquer, it is NOT considered a Major Villain for world-domination purposes.  (They _are_ retired, after all.) You can win the game without defeating retired dungeons, so if in doubt, give them a shot!
