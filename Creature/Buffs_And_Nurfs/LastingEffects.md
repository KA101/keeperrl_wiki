This page is a list of buffs and nurfs that your creatures can aquire.

- Rings, amulets, mushrooms and potions can be formed out of each type of buff, although most of them will only exist in the game if you wish for them using the wishing spell.
- Rings and amulets can be formed out of a buff and grant that buff to the owner when worn on the fingers on around the neck.
- Mushrooms can be formed out of buffs and either permanently or temporarily provide the buff after being eaten.
- Potions are special because they can be thrown at other creatures to inflict nurfs or give buffs. They can also be drunk by the owner.#
 
- Potions and mushrooms can also exist in two forms:

-1) Temporary effect
-2) Permanent Effect
