Many of the creatures you will enocunter in KeeperRL are unique to the game and you won't find them in other games


Some of the creatures will be immediately familiar because they are stereo-typical:


- Humans: Often rather weak and inferior, such as peseants but occasionally powerful mages or accomplished knights etc.

- Elves: Agilie and dexterous, making them skilled archers. Often highly intelligent with a strong connection to woodland nature.

- Dwarves: Quite strong, stout and resilient, especially underground. Uusally skilled in mining or crafting. 

- Dragons: Powerful creatures with immense strength and magical abilities. They can breathe fire or other elements.

- Goblins: Usually smaller and weaker than other creatures, but they are often cunning and can be good with traps. Some of them become decent mages or shaman and the stronger ones are more orc-like, being tougher, and making them good warriors.

- Gnomes: Small, humanoid creatures and mischievous and curious. Known for their technical skills and affinity for tinkering with machines and magical devices.

- Unicorns: Horses with a single, spiraling horn. Pure beings but tough and magical with a closeness to the spirit world.

- Giant animals: Much larger than they are in the real world. They can range from oversized insects to humanoid giants. More dangerous and difficult to defeat.

- Cyclops: A type of giant humanoid creature with a single eye in the center of their forehead. They are brutish and violent, with a love for battle and a short temper.

- Golems: Creatures made of inanimate materials, such as clay or adamantium, that have been imbued with magical energy to come to life.

- Hydra: A creature with multiple heads. Chopping off just one head is not going to kill them.

- Zombies: Undead creatures that are mindless, aggressive monsters that feel no pain and can lose body parts without bleeding. Stepping into the sunlight is fatal for them.

- Vampires: Undead creatures that feed on the blood of the living. Sophisticated, often with magical powers and sometimes the ability to fly or use telepathy. Die in the sun.

Skeletons: Mindless undead animated by magic that can survive in the sun and make use of weapons and bows properly.
