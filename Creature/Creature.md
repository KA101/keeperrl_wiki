Many of the creatures you will enocunter in KeeperRL are unique to the game and you won't find them in other games


Some of the creatures will be immediately familiar because they are stereo-typical:


- Humans: Often rather weak and inferior, such as peseants but occasionally powerful mages or accomplished knights etc.

- Elves: Agilie and dexterous, making them skilled archers. Often highly intelligent with a strong connection to woodland nature.

- Dwarves: Quite strong, stout and resilient, especially underground. Uusally skilled in mining or crafting. 

- Dragons: Powerful creatures with immense strength and magical abilities. They can breathe fire or other elements.

- Goblins: Usually smaller and weaker than other creatures, but they are often cunning and can be good with traps. Some of them become decent mages or shaman and the stronger ones are more orc-like, being tougher, and making them good warriors.
