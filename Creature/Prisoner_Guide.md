Prisoner Guide
--------------
It's not without reason your reputable establishment is called a Dungeon.  From time to time you may wish to take prisoners, whether to force them to labor on your behalf or to make them a Join or Die offer.  Even the "less evil" Castle Keeper has need of cost-effective mining labor, after all.

But your prison is only so large, and some creatures are better than others, but may or may not make good prisoners vs recruits, or may be more trouble than they're worth.  This Prisoner Guide will help you set up effective prisons and fill them with solid choices to better advance your dungeon.


*HOWTO Prison*

Prisons are available to Classic, Castle, and Greenskin keepers.  Necromancers prefer "animated" workers, and the Gnomes & Dwarves aren't in the slavery business.
Keepers with access to prisons can build them from the start (no technology is required) BUT they require 15 Iron per tile, plus more for the Door and perhaps for any prison bars the Keeper may care to install.

Prisoners require one prison tile per prisoner: this is a hard cap on the amount of prisoners you may hold.  In order for Prison tiles to hold prisoners, they must be enclosed by some combination of walls (natural stone is fine), prison bars, or prison doors.  The advantage of prison bars is that they permit units to see and make ranged attacks through them; conversely, they cost 5 iron per tile.

Prisoners return to a Prison tile to rest, but otherwise have no Quarters or other such individual requirements.  As such, one or two communal cells can serve to hold your prison labor force; some players prefer to construct individual cells, which may increase the time needed to breach any given cell in the event of a prison uprising, but becomes significantly more expensive in terms of iron, dungeon space, and prisoner response time.  For comparison, a 3x5 communal cell using stone walls will cost 255 iron, whereas 15 individual cells (also relying on stone walls) would cost 675 iron in total.

Torture tables and beast cages, though appearing in the Prison tab, need not be built on Prison tiles or enclosed by walls/bars/door.  Beasts who are not Steeds will use the cages as humanoids use Beds, undead use Coffins, and Steeds use Stables.  Torture tables will likewise be used without need to secure them.

*Let's Get Digging*

"These peasants mine too slowly.  I need better diggers!"-most every Castle Keeper ever

Indeed, humans are Large and more adapted to living on the surface.  For subterranean construction, Dwarves are stereotypically the way to go in most fantasy settings, and KeeperRL bears that out.  Bearded Dwarves' digging speed will not disappoint, though in the event they witness friendly casualties they may snap into an Insane fury, attacking others around and possibly causing a casualty spiral in your workforce.  Non-bearded Dwarves are better crafters and dig almost as well, so they're a strong candidate to be taken prisoner for labor purposes.

Giant Ants are also a stong choice for digging.  Though they will not craft and might not haul (being Beasts), some Keepers prefer to divide tasks such that diggers focus on digging whilst others (such as Imps, who have unlimited carrying capacity) handle the hauling.


*Prison Labor*

Since crafting skills scale with distance from the Dungeon, most Keepers first encounter crafters capable of handling Adamantine as enemies.  Prisoners can and will employ their crafting skills on your behalf, and when you consider the cost of high-end Quarters for someone with 20+ levels of combat experience, letting the prisoner Dwarves make your gear looks quite reasonable.  Fortunately, prisoner crafters do not slow-work, strike, or sabotage your operations (or the output); at worst, since they cannot equip gear you may not issue prisoner crafters fast-crafting jewelry.

Gnomes can also make good crafter prisoners; the Gnome Chief you may encounter in enemy dungeons has a baseline 50 Jeweller skill, which makes him quite quick to stamp out glyphs at the Lava Jeweller.  Should you encounter the "wrong" (finding the Human smith as a Classic keeper, for example) Skilled Blacksmith early on, capturing them could speed gear progression as well.

It's generally best not to take too many crafter prisoners early on; a campaign with 12-14 of each type of villain will likely go far enough afield that near the end, difficulty-scaling will also provide Dwarves with 80+ Forge skill.  Fine Adoxium or Infernite gear is a lovely thing to be able to make in late-game.


*Join Us*

One of the quicker methods to decide who might make a good converted-prisoner recruit is simple: who would you rather **not** be fighting?  Chances are your opposition will have a similar outlook.  ;-)

However, that isn't always a viable option.  You may not be familiar with everyone, and some creatures have logistical differences that aren't obvious until they're in your service.  So let's take a look at some units and see what makes them good, or not so good, candidates for conversion.
(Bear in mind! whether a creature converts or not is based on their internal creatureId, whicch is generated when the game first created them and is NOT player-visible, nor is it reasonably player-manipulable.  As such, it's best to capture many creatures of the same type, as the odds are you will get half of them, or maybe less.)

Good:
- Lizardmen: These ferocious swamp-dwellers have an intrinsic speed bonus (their first movement per turn is free) and they have an additional bite attack with  a solid cance to inflict Poison.  Keepers who want a strong offensive option and don't mind killing every hostile in the fight will find Lizardmen a fine choice for converted troops.  (Poison doesn't go away when a creature is Stunned, though, so without manually curing the poison, manually healing, or a Regeneration effect present on the victim, potential prisoners will almost certainly to poisoning.)
- Cyclops: He's Huge and his hammer hits unprepared Keepers hard.  With intrinsic Ranged Resistance, that Cyclops you may have considered an annoying pest can instead become a fine front-line melee tank, especially against lower-level Elf or Dryad sites.  Properly armed and armored, they also serve as solid front-gate guards, or can breach up or down stairways where you expect trouble.  Further, the Cyclops' death drops can also drop if he is killed on the table, so there's really no reason not to capture and attempt conversion.
- Minotaur: You might not have realized that big ol' bull-men are available in KeeperRL.  (Check underneath the Duke's castle!) The Minotaur is generally a better melee comatant than the Cyclops, and while he does not offer death drops, the Minotaur has the "Steed" binary skill, so he can carry a Rider.  In a pinch, this gives human-sized fighters someone who might take a hit or two for them; if successfully converted, though, the Minotaur can equip gear and trains up like any other humanoid melee fighter.  Except he's Melee Resistant and has another fighter on his back, so you're looking at a solid front-line combat unit, whether on defense or offense.
- The Duke: While taking him alive in the Duel may not be the best situation (his troops will follow him around, quickly becoming a traffic hazard), if you attacked the castle you might well have taken him intact.  He's just as fearsome as he was against you, though as infantry he's not as fast and doesn't have his warhorse backing him up.
- Dragons, generally: Dragons fly, intrinsically regenerate (new in 1.0), and will haste & heal you when they feel it necessary, even if not converted.  Conversion is a risk, but whether the scales and the dragon corpse are worth more or less than a noncombat dragon Steed is a decision individual Keepers must make based on their circumstances.  Yellow and White dragons are generally safe for support troops as well, since their breath attacks only hit the intended targets, so all else being equal, it's probably worth taking the chance.


Not so good:
- Dwarves: Sure, they make fine workers and craftsdwarves.  Your combat troops would be Underprepared without them! but one bad random roll on Mentally Unstable, and the bad situatoin of your taking a casualty suddenly becomes much worse as the dwarf you trained to fight suddenly starts attacking your own troops.  Not a risk worth taking.
- Warriors: Soldiers who Bear out when under 50% health (healing to full in the bargain) sound impressive, but once in your service, you'll find that they shift as soon as their ability to do so comes off of cooldown.  This results in grossly extended training and gearing times, inability to reliably dig or haul, and headaches all around.  Don't waste your time and theirs.
- Elementalist: While someone summoning elementals as shaman-type minions summon spirits may sound good (and it probably hurt a bit if the Elementalist sieged your dungeon), they will continue to summon elementals while in your base.  This includes fire elementals, who will commonly ignite wooden beds, floors, bridges, trees, etc.  Keepers who appreciate not having to worry about their dungeon catching fire should consider recruiting other creatures.
- Red Dragons: While dragons are generally a fine choice of mount, red dragons' fiery breath and flame-ring spell are very, very good at starting fires and disrupting bboth dungeon and attack plans.  This is right and proper when they're attacking you, but not always desirable when you're attacking the enemy (you may want the tree spirits' bodies intact, for example, or perhaps you may have ground-based backup troops in the White Dragon's ice lair who won't appreciate their footing being melted out from under them) and definitely not grand when you're defending your front gate in a wooded mountain.
