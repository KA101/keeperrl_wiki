Summary
-------

These demons are dwellers of the tribe of Demonshrine and are provoked
to war by building demon altars. It is sometimes worth leaving their
demon lord alone, so that you can farm the demon dwellers for their gold
as they immigrate to Demonshrine and then proceed to attack your
dungeon.
