Converting prisoners
====================

-   You need torture tables, a population slot and a suitable prisoner
    to convert
-   Failure chance is 50%, which means they die without converting to
    your dungeon

Best types of prisoners
=======================

-   [/keeperrl_wiki/Cyclops](/keeperrl_wiki/Cyclops "wikilink") make excellent fighters when fully
    equipped
-   The [Vampire Lord](/keeperrl_wiki/Vampire_Lord "wikilink") is a powerful spell
    caster
-   [Elven archers](/keeperrl_wiki/Elven_Archer "wikilink") and
    [driads](/keeperrl_wiki/Driad "wikilink") are better archers than you can recruit,
    so they are often worth it
-   [Dwarves](/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf "wikilink") make excellent diggers in your mines
-   [Knights](/keeperrl_wiki/Knight "wikilink") have melee resistance
-   [Human archers](/keeperrl_wiki/Archer "wikilink") are the best archers.
-   Most bosses are worth it, so [Elf Lord](/keeperrl_wiki/Elf_Lord "wikilink"), [Dwarf
    Baron](/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf_Baron "wikilink") and the [Duke](Duke "wikilink")
-   Lizardmen have a speed bonus and an optional poison +8 attack
    unarmed
-   The [/keeperrl_wiki/Elementalist](/keeperrl_wiki/Elementalist "wikilink") sucks, he can't even
    summon elementals, so don't bother with him
-   You aren't likely to find a [/keeperrl_wiki/Minotaur](/keeperrl_wiki/Minotaur "wikilink")
    (sometimes they live below castles and they are powerful)
-   The [lizardman chief](/keeperrl_wiki/Lizardman_Chief "wikilink") is a bit special
-   [Warriors](/keeperrl_wiki/Warrior "wikilink") from the Viking tribe are very good
-   When you come up against enemy keepers, some of the minions will be
    better than yours if you can get them
-   You can capture enemy [/keeperrl_wiki/Keepers](/keeperrl_wiki/Keeper "wikilink")
-   In endless mode, always take any prisoners you can get, because they
    will be buffed
-   Basically, capture any powerful humanoid

Looking after prisoners
=======================

-   Try not to capture more prisoners than you can look after
-   [Wolves](/keeperrl_wiki/Wolf "wikilink") are good at looking after prisoners
    because you can get a whole pack of them for 1 population slot
