Summary
-------

Sturdy opponents not to be underestimated early in the game. You need to
get used to the idea that a dwarf wielding a battle axe with armour,
boots and helmet really can wipe the floor with a small party of fully
armed orcs. You will need something stronger to deal with them, so don't
go running in and steal their stuff straight away. Dwarves are also
expert diggers and will dig into your dungeon when provoked making them
more dangerous if you do not take the fight to them first.
