''They are after gold.

Summary
-------

They are common in mountainous areas and like to inhabit caves. They can
see your wealth and once the temptation is too much, try to access your
[treasure room](/keeperrl_wiki/Treasure_Room "wikilink") to steal the gold and then
run away. If you are overpowered early on in the game, they can be
bribed to leave you alone. Such cowardice is normally very much less
satisfying than killing them all and taking their swords for your army.
