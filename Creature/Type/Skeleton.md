Summary
-------

A cheap unit with fair attack and defense, thrives primarily with
archery.

Unlike other Undead this minion is not weak against sunlight and is
delightfully expendable. Do you have extra weapons and gear you will
never use late game? Grab a skeleton, load your little buddy up, and go
attack something with no regrets when he dies. Well dies again. This can
expose new parts of the map, trigger traps your nicer minions might
break a nail on and possibly even kill a thing or two! He doesn't mind.
Look at that happy toothy grin!
