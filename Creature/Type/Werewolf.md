Summary
-------

A stealthy, regenerating fighter. Has a reasonable early game unarmed
attack if you are unable to find them a weapon. Night vision,
regeneration, resistance to magic and stealth add up to a good snack for
a doppleganger, although once fully trained make a great solo in their
own right. They can level up many levels by killing enemy creatures. A
few werewolves additionally have an ambush ability allowing them to hide
themselves and attack by surprise. They can be one of the best minions
for a keeper.
