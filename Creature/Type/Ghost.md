Summary
-------

In some earlier versions, these creatures could hit multiple times and
turn invisible bringing an entire army into madness. Perhaps one of the
gods were angry because lately they die as they strike their targets and
always remain visible. Other than that, sending an enemy insane is still
a great way to severely weaken your enemies.
