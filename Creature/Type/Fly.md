Summary

Summoned by [summon insects](:Spells#Summon_Insects "wikilink") spell.
These creatures are nothing but a distraction, but they are a good
distraction. They buzz in the faces of enemies obscuring their vision
until the invader is forced to swat them away. All the while, you jab at
the unfortunate intruder with swords and arrows. They are not a bad
deal.
