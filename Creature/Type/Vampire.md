Summary
-------

A good early game spell caster with complimentary combat skills. Poison
resistance provides an advantage against ants. They are useful inside
your dungeon against invaders, especially knights and golems that have a
resistance to melee attacks but can be hurt using magic. They are not
recommended to travel far with since they crumble to dust in sunlight
and it isn't pretty.

When facing these in enemy dungeons, can be damaged using silver swords
and sometimes tempted out into an open battlefield where they forget the
time and can meet the sunrise.
