Summary
-------

Knights are rock hard hand-to-hand fighting units. When equipped with a
decent weapon and good armour, even more so. They are great to capture
and convert. They also provide the opportunity to give melee resistance
when absorbed by a doppleganger, although you will be tempted to use
them as warriors in their own right.
