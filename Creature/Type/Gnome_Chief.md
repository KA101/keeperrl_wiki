Summary
-------

They are excellent at making good jewelry quickly and settle as tribes
in random dungeons found in the mountains. Keepers that can't be
bothered to make peace with the little folk are often accustomed to
over-powering them and taking them back to the dungeon in chains.
Otherwise, the dungeons are quite interesting and can contain rare items
and monsters. To be honest the Gnome Chief is a weak trophy, but it is
always fun to twist his ears.
