Summary
-------

These are the inhabitants of many a forest in our land. When they die,
they leave behind wood that can be plundered. Because they are slow
creatures, a tribe of tree spirits can be killed fairly easily by a well
equipped werewolf, which can gain up to about 6 levels for it. They can
be rather good xp.
