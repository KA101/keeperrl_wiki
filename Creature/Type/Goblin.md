Summary
-------

The best crafting minion in the game and the only regular minion to know
how to see and disarm traps in enemy dungeons. Once you have crafted an
armour set and weaponry, you may wish to absorb them into a doppleganger
so it can learn about traps. Occasionally you get insane goblins with an
amazing ability to craft special armour and weapons that are usually
only found in distant lands.

Insane Goblins
--------------

They will immediately get into fights with your other minions. Make them
a little room of their own. Give them a forge and workshop stand. Give
them a bed and a supply of pigs to keep them happy. Take them directly
to their new room. Lock the door. Get them crafting while they are still
excited about joining your dungeon, since they need to have a high
morale to get anything really useful from them.
