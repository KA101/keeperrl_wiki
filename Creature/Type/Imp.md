''Warlock's best workers

Summary
-------

Your workforce for resource gathering, construction and hauling jobs.
Imps can carry an almost unlimited amount of weight. They are also
adorable and fantastic for scouting if you have four or less as the
first four cost nothing to replace. Imps are cowards though and run away
from their own shadows half the time, even when it can't be bother to
give chase.

Spawning Cost (gold)
--------------------

The first four imps are always free. After that they cost an increasing
amount of gold to summon.
