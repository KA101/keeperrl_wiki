In this game, an attribute bonus is a boost to a specific attribute that can be gained through various means such as equipment, consumables, or character progression.


For example, a player may equip a sword that provides a bonus to melee damage, increasing their "MELEE_DAMAGE" attribute. Similarly, a potion may temporarily boost a player's "SPELL_SPEED" attribute, decreasing the cooldown time for casting spells.


Attribute bonuses can also be earned through character progression. For example, combat abilities improve when killing tribe leaders. Using consumables to boost attributes can be possible, such as defence mushrooms that protect you. These bonuses may be permanent or temporary, and can greatly impact a creature's effectiveness in combat and other aspects of the game.
