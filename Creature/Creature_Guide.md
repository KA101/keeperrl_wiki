''Feared by the weak, useful to the strong.  These powerful constructs guard substantial underground adamantium deposits, but for those strong enough to
defeat them, are just that much more adamantine.

''A deadly vortex of turbulent wind, commonly supporting Elementalists and occasionally found in dungeons.

[Angel](/keeperrl_wiki/Angel "wikilink")

spells in order to heal.

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Antq.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Antq.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Antq.png" width="100" />
''A Minor Villain, the Ant Queen leads her colony.  Fortunately, she cannot hatch new ants rapidly enough to affect attacks on her; unfortunately, she has the same poison as her warriors, so she can avenge herself upon an unprepared Ant Queen Slayer even after her death.

[Ant Worker](/keeperrl_wiki/Ant_Worker "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Antwork.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Antwork.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Antwork.png" width="100" />
''Ant Workers are civilians of the ant culture; they can dig, and some Keepers have been known to capture them as slave miners, but ultimately they are not a significant threat in battle.

[Archer](/keeperrl_wiki/Archer "wikilink")
''Human Archers vary in talent and training, but their arrows are ignored at your peril.  Knight-trained archers in particular enjoy the ability to fire through specially designed walls, meaning that you might feel the archer before you see them!

[Automaton](/keeperrl_wiki/Automaton "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Automaton.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Automaton.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Automaton.png" width="100" />

[Bandit](/keeperrl_wiki/Bandit "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Bandit.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Bandit.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Bandit.png" width="100" />

the bandits back.

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Bat.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Bat.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Bat.png" width="100" />

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Black_Dragon.png" title="fig:/keeperrlwiki/Black_Dragon.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Black_Dragon.png" width="100" />
''Blind but telepathic, the Black Dragon hunts in darkness and brings it upon all it encounters.  Absent telepathy of your own, your ranged units will have difficulty
engaging this terror of the underground, so best to fight it in a confined space where your melee fighter can protect the rest of your people.
Black Dragons make for fine converts, however, and their scales excel at protecting undead from the Sun's terror.

[Black Market Guard](/keeperrl_wiki/Black_Market_Guard "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Black_Market_Guard.png" title="fig:/keeperrlwiki/Black_Market_Guard.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Black_Market_Guard.png" width="100" />
''It's not clear how the Guards of the Black Market got as strong as they did, but they're the controlling tribe there and some of the toughest melee troops in the realm.  They're capable of defeating most troublemakers in a fair fight...so if you plan on starting trouble, best to bring backup, magic, and generally not to fight fair.

[Black Rat](/keeperrl_wiki/Black_Rat "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Black_Rat.png" title="fig:/keeperrlwiki/Black_Rat.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Black_Rat.png" width="100" />
''Black Rats are an underground species that has grown tolerant of plagues which fell most other creatures.  Be careful in their presence, as plague is far more persistent than poison, and can spread through contact.

[Boar](/keeperrl_wiki/Boar "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Boar.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Boar.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Boar.png" width="100" />

''Desert beasts of burden and mounts.

[Cave Bear](/keeperrl_wiki/Cave_Bear "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Bear.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Bear.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Bear.png" width="100" />
''Bears do not appreciate being bothered, but are large enough to serve Large creatures as a mount in a pinch.

[Chicken](/keeperrl_wiki/Chicken "wikilink")
''Livestock animals who at best can spot incoming attackers...but whose speed and flight capability could be very useful if there were some way to transfer it to another creature.  Their corpses can also be of use to Necromancers.

[Child](/keeperrl_wiki/Child "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Peasantkid.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Peasantkid.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Peasantkid.png" width="100" />

[Child As Spider Food](/keeperrl_wiki/Child_As_Spider_Food "wikilink")
''Unfortunately, sometimes children explore places they shouldn't, or particularly vile evildoers get lucky.  These poor children are not a threat either, but your creatures are doing them a favor.  :-(

[Clay Golem](/keeperrl_wiki/Clay_Golem "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Clay_Golem.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Clay_Golem.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Clay_Golem.png" width="100" />

[Cow](/keeperrl_wiki/Cow "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Cow.png" title="fig:/keeperrlwiki/Cow.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Cow.png" width="100" />
''Livestock animal.  If raised on your cow pasture or purchased by a Lawful Knight, they help raise your population cap; otherwise, not useful, unless you're a Necromancer.

[Cyclops](/keeperrl_wiki/Cyclops "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Cyclops.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Cyclops.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Cyclops.png" width="100" />
''A nasty Minor Villain for unprepared Keepers, the Cyclops correctly realizes that large groups of cretures can be a threat, and will actively attack dungeons that reach 13 population.  Cyclopes are resistant to arrows and are effective melee fighters, so it's best to bring support troops and set up opportunities to flank.

That said, cyclopes are not only fine candidates for conversion, but their brains can make potions which improve the drinker's defense; particularly legendary rafters have been known to use cyclops testicles to decorate helmets.  No matter what, a defeated cyclops is helpful.

[Dark Elf](/keeperrl_wiki/Dark_Elf "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Dark_/keeperrl_wiki/Elf.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Dark_/keeperrl_wiki/Elf.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Dark_/keeperrl_wiki/Elf.png" width="100" />

'' Lord of his caves; his elfbow and faster magic can pose a nasty surprise to Lawful keepers attacking the Dark Elves.

[Dark Elf Warrior](/keeperrl_wiki/Dark_Elf_Warrior "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Dark_Elf_/keeperrl_wiki/Warrior.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Dark_Elf_/keeperrl_wiki/Warrior.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Dark_Elf_/keeperrl_wiki/Warrior.png" width="100" />
'' Defender of the dark elves.  Evil keepers may be able to recruit some for a price, but they don't seem to really excel in any particualr dungeon employment.

[Death](/keeperrl_wiki/Death "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Death.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Death.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Death.png" width="100" />
'' For all the death Keepers cause, it's surprising that Death doesn't make a personal appearance.  But if you seek Him out, and come properly prepared, perhaps
you might experience a change of fortune at the last moment...

[Deer](/keeperrl_wiki/Deer "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Deer.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Deer.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Deer.png" width="100" />
'' Sometimes glimpsed running through the trees, Deer are fairly harmless to anything larger than a goblin.  Goblins themselves have been known to press captive deer
into service as mounts, if nothing better is avialable.

[Demon Dweller](/keeperrl_wiki/Demon_Dweller "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Demon_Dweller.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Demon_Dweller.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Demon_Dweller.png" width="100" />
'' Soldiers of the Demonshrine; they're quite dangerous in large numbers and by surprise, but when attacking dungeons which have undertaken demon worship, they're less
dangerous than Angels.

[Demon Lord](/keeperrl_wiki/Demon_Lord "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Demon_Lord.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Demon_Lord.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Demon_Lord.png" width="100" />
'' Major Villain and head of the Demonshrine.  Not that much more dangeroud than his minions, but his gifts are dangerous to the unwary.

[Djinn](/keeperrl_wiki/Djinn "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Djinn.png" title="fig:/keeperrlwiki/Djinn.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Djinn.png" width="100" />
''Mythical desert spirit and granter of wishes to those who can find and best him in battle.

[Dog](/keeperrl_wiki/Dog "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Dog.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Dog.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Dog.png" width="100" /> 
''Woofums! Dogs are beloved of Lawful Keepers as well as the KeeperRL developer.  They can help out in melee combat, but should not be mistaken for high-end combat troops.

[Donkey](/keeperrl_wiki/Donkey "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Don/keeperrl_wiki/Key.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Don/keeperrl_wiki/Key.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Don/keeperrl_wiki/Key.png" width="100" />
'' Farm animal and mount for Peasants; you could capture one if you can't find other steeds.

[Doppleganger](/keeperrl_wiki/Doppleganger "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Doppleganger.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Doppleganger.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Doppleganger.png" width="100" />
'' Absorber of living bodies and their capabilities, the Doppelganger can be one of the scarier demons available to Evil Keepers. Conversely, they're reputed
to never be *quite* as capable as the folks they absorb, so their true capability is in mixing the abilites of many different creatures.  Keepers have been known to wish there were some way they could gain the absorbption capabilities of a Doppleganger for themselves...

[Dragon](/keeperrl_wiki/Dragon "wikilink")
''Dragons are generally Huge beasts capable of winged flight and devastating bites and breath, but vulnerable to archers.  Keepers often prize them as personal mounts. Since they're generally classified by their color, check specific colors of dragon for more information.

[Driad](/keeperrl_wiki/Driad "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Driad.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Driad.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Driad.png" width="100" />
'' Tree dwellers who can see and shoot past threes as though the trees were not there, Driads can and will shoot any invader they can see to pieces.  If only there was a way to spot them first...

[Duke](/keeperrl_wiki/Duke "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Knightboss.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Knightboss.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Knightboss.png" width="100" />
''Mighty human Major Villain (from Evil Keepers' perspective).  Dukes frequently fight from the back of a mighty Warhorse, using battle axes of Rage, as well as joining the battle alongside their competent and well-equipped melee troops with archer support, making their castles a formidable challenge to attackers.

However, their personal prowess also makes them a fine choice for capture and conversion.

[Dwarf](/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf.png" width="100" />
'' An armoured fighter who protects the mountain burrows, Dwarves are a serious threat to weaker Keepers, but more-experienced Keepers and troops can take advantage of the fact that they can't always handle seeing their friends die.

[Dwarf Baron](/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf_Baron "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarfboss.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarfboss.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarfboss.png" width="100" />
'' King under the mountain, the Dwarf Baron is a melee powerhouse of similar quality to the human Duke.  However, the confined space of the mountain burrows greatly reduces the threat of flanking.  Dwarves also don't maintain strong archer troops, so the support threats which make the Duke a serious threat are greatly lessened here.

[Dwarf Female](/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf_Female "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf_F.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf_F.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Dwarf_F.png" width="100" />

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Elementalist.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Elementalist.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Elementalist.png" width="100" />
''Major Villain.  Elementalists typicaly live in tall-but-narrow towers, forcing attackers to fight through small spaces where elementals can flank them.
When attacking dungeons, Elementalists have been known to stay well away from the entry point and summon a stream of elementals to go in and attack, forcing the defenders to sally forth and directly engage without benefit of defensive structures, traps, etc.

[Elf](/keeperrl_wiki/Elf "wikilink")
<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Elf.png" title="fig:/keeperrl_wiki/Elf.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Elf.png" width="100" />
''Not generally dangerous, and also not much worth capturing.

[Elf Archer](/keeperrl_wiki/Elf_Archer "wikilink")
''Elven archers head up outlying elf settlements, and can be dangerous if found outdoors, as they're similarly good shots to the Driads.  However, they're generally the only combatant, so can be chased down.

[Elf Child](/keeperrl_wiki/Elf_Child "wikilink")
<img src="elf_/keeperrl_wiki/Child.png" title="fig:elf_/keeperrl_wiki/Child.png" alt="elf_/keeperrl_wiki/Child.png" width="100" />

''Lord of the forest, and pairs high-powered elfbow with faster-magic staff.  With archer support, can be far more dangerous than the Dark Elf Lord.

[Elven Archer](/keeperrl_wiki/Elven_Archer "wikilink")
<img src="elf_/keeperrl_wiki/Archer.png" title="fig:elf_/keeperrl_wiki/Archer.png" alt="elf_/keeperrl_wiki/Archer.png" width="100" />
''Elven archers head up outlying elf settlements, and can be dangerous if found outdoors, as they're similarly good shots to the Driads.  However, they're generally the only combatant, so can be chased down.

[Ent](/keeperrl_wiki/Ent "wikilink")
''These tree spirits can deal greivous damage if they make it to melee range.  However, they're slow, so even their arrow-resistance doesn't help too much; from time to
time they'll let folks ride them, but sadly (for them) elven archers typically don't.  They're worth a considerable amount of lumber when felled, as well as
the rare and useful Archwood.

[Eskimo](/keeperrl_wiki/Eskimo "wikilink")

''These spirits of the restless dead turn up at night near ruins, seek out travelers, and attempt to scare them into temporary insanity.  Trouble is, the scare
attempt effectively self-banishes the ghost, so they're not much of a threat to any prepared group.

[Green Dragon](/keeperrl_wiki/Green_Dragon "wikilink")
