In this game, the human settlements range from small cottages to large castles, each with their own distinct architectural features, inhabitants, and levels of defense.


A village, may be a classic example of a wooden human settlement, with buildings made primarily of wood and occasionally a shop that specializes in armory. The inhabitants are typically human tribe loyalists, led by a knight who is responsible for overseeing the defense of the village. Knights and archers protect the peasants, children, donkeys, horses, cows, and pigs that inhabit the village, and larger villages even have names.


Lone human cottages are another type of settlement that can be found scattered throughout the maps. These cottages are typically inhabited by peasants, children, and various animals, including horses, donkeys, cows, pigs, and goats. They are often surrounded by crops, and occasionally have a guardian witchman. Some buildings may even have cellars, which can serve as storage areas for food or other supplies.


Eskimo cottages, on the other hand, are located in snowy locations and are inhabited by Eskimos and Eskimo children. Unlike other settlements, they have no crops and may occasionally have a snowman. Similarly, nomad cottages are located in deserts and are made with sandstone walls. They are typically inhabited by nomads, goats, camels, and nomad children, and do not grow crops.


Blacksmiths and artisan legends are also present in the game, and are typically located in town settings with a forge. They may have cellars and are defended by knights and archers. Lone guard posts, which are also defended by knights and archers, are located on the maps and typically have cows, donkeys, and dogs. They may even have a second floor above some stairs.


Warriors are another type of settlement, typically inhabiting a castle-like location with wooden structures and led by a shaman. They are located in a town setting and may have a gold treasure chest stockpile. They can trigger when a throne is built and may attack the player's keeper, though they may accept ransoms.


Knights live in castles, led by a duke and defended by knights, archers, and priests. Peasants, children, donkeys, cows, and pigs are often in the area, and shops may be present. They may also attack the player if they build a throne or display impaled heads. Teutons are another type of castle-dweller, with brick structures and human tribe loyalists led by a teuton boss. They are defended by teutons and friars and typically have a gold treasure chest stockpile.


Elementalists are unique settlements, living in brick towers and having human tribe loyalties. The elementalist is the leader and is typically surrounded by their elementals. They can attack and tend to stand at a distance while their servants do the fighting.


Bandits, on the other hand, are usually cave dwellers led by a bandit leader and with their own bandit tribe loyalties. They may ambush players, get greedy for gold, attack to steal gold, and demand ransoms. Desert thieves are another type of settlement, living in sandstone-walled castles in the desert biome with a leader and fighters including thieves and a unique sorcerer. They ride camels and can ambush players if triggered by anger at a throne or an impaled head, and will attack to kill enemy leaders. They stockpile gold in treasure chests, have furniture, and mount beasts. Immigrants are mostly other thieves who can fight. There is sometimes a Djinn residing a the sandstone maze below.


The goblin settlements can offer a range of challenges and rewards for players to explore. The settlements range from small cottages to large towns and dungeons, each with their own unique features and inhabitants. Goblin cottages are often found in areas that were previously inhabited by elves, and larger goblin groups may be led by trolls with bandit tribe loyalties. These groups may have extra melee, spell, and archery training and may ambush unsuspecting players when they counter-attack.


Goblin settlements are can be similar to human settlements, but with their own unique twist. Players may also encounter goblin caves that are populated by goblin warriors with tribe loyalties to greenskins. These caves often contain furniture and may receive immigration of goblin warriors with fighter traits. A network of goblin caves can exist underground, creating a string of Goblin Caves with multiple levels that become increasingly challenging as players progress deeper into the caves. These networks can be led by a troll, adding an extra layer of difficulty to exploring these locations.


The largest goblin settlements can be led by the goblin king, who rules over a population of goblin warriors, guards, wizards, archers, priests, and kaboomers, as well as a troll. These larger locations are typically well-equipped, containing furniture and other items that players can loot. The inhabitants of these settlements may ambush players when they get greedy for gold, attacking to steal the player's gold and demanding ransoms. These locations receive immigration from other greenskins over time and may be built on displaced dwarven villages.


Dwarf settlements in the game also have some variety. Dwarf Vaults are found in z-level locations below the player's base and are populated by dwarves with tribe loyalties to other dwarves. Other Dwarf Caves can be mine town dungeons inhabited by dwarves led by a dwarf leader who stockpiles minerals and builds mines in places surrounded by natural resources. Deeper down into the z-levels, players will encounter dwarf fighters with increasing skill in melee combat.

 
The dwarves are triggered to attack when provoked or stolen from. However, players can often call off the attack by offering ransoms to the dwarves. The most grand dwarven location is the huge minetown dungeon, led by a dwarf baron and featuring furniture, stockpiles, chests, and a shop. These locations can be challenging to navigate but offer players significant rewards for their efforts.


Various z-levels include rat caves and bat z-levels, vaults occupied by the respective monster types. The rat caves can be home to rat fighters, led by a rat king. Lava Z-levels can be ruled by a red dragon leader using fire elementals as fighters. A Z-level zombie castle, is infested by swarmer zombies. It can be a challenging location to conquer due to the zombie hordes. Black dragons can exist in a castle with a layout similar to dwarves, but with a black dragon occuptant that has suplanted them. Balrog z-levels are castle-like with a balrog leader and loyalties to other monsters. It is populated by trolls, goblin warriors, and goblin archers being dangerous to explore.

The cottages are furnished, and the inhabits include deadly archers, non-fighter elf children, and animals.


There are also dark elf locations, including the Dark Elf Caves, which are mine town dungeons that house dark elves led by warriors. The dark elves are triggered to attack when provoked or stolen from by your outlaws, and they stockpile minerals but can sometimes accept ransoms for temporary peace. The fighters in these location are warriors who improve their melee combat skills as you move deeper underground.


More powerful dark elven allies and enemies are located in minetown dungeons, which are usually given a friendly name at the bottom of a few z-levels with dungeon furniture.

The gnomes are located in a minetown dungeon and their tribe is loyal to itself but peaceful to many. Their leader is a gnome chief and the inhabitants consist of gnomes that can sometimes fight but never choose to invade. The gnomes tend to have a level connection to some layers of dungeons. The settlement at the bottom will be a mine town and is usually given a name for a town far underground. Their shops have useful equipment. 


Lizardman tribes come in different sizes. Lizardmen live in forest cottages, which can surplant elven cottages. Primarily fighters and loyal to their kind, mixing only with other lizardmen.

Black Rats tend not to fight with ants but they do fight and often carry plagues. They can also be found built on the bones of other settlements and be surrounded by natural ores.


Some monsters live in isolation and can take over other settlements, such as the Giant Spider Caves or the Cyclops Cave, which are inhabited by hostile creatures that attack players.
