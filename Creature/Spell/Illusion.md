*Summoned by [deception](Deception "wikilink") spell.* A copy of
the caster used to distract enemies. The creature that summoned the
illusions views them as transparent to differentiate between themselves
and the illusions. To other creatures(that did not summon the illusions)
they appear the same as the caster.
