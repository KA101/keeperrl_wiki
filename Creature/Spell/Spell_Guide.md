**Spells** are active abilities with cooldown between uses that can be
learned by your [Keeper](/keeperrl_wiki/Keeper "wikilink") and some of your
[Minions](/keeperrl_wiki/Minions "wikilink").

Spells known are based on your Magic Damage training, with each level of
training providing a new spell. This means that only the Keeper can
learn all spells in the game, as his or her Magic Damage training caps
at +12, which is the requirement for the highest level spell. All other
monsters will only learn spells up to their own Magic Damage training
cap. This also means that you will need [Sorcery
techs](/keeperrl_wiki/Sorcery "wikilink") to train the spells of your
minions in your dungeon, as wooden, iron and golden bookcases cap at +3,
+7 and +12 Magic Damage training, respectively; yet your minions can
gain spells beyond your current Sorcery tech level by training their
Magic Damage in combat, gaining new spells as they reach higher Magic
Damage training.

Cooldown of spell uses is affected by your [Sorcery
skill](/keeperrl_wiki/Sorcery "wikilink"), with maximum /keeperrl_wiki/Sorcery skill (100%)
halving the cooldown of all spells.
