"Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a subgenre of role-playing computer games traditionally characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permanent death of the player character. Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons." (Wikipedia December 2022)


Roguelike gameplay is especially fun when you're controlling a party of creatures.


In a party, know the members:

Each party member can have unique abilities and strengths. Take the time to understand each character's skills, stats, and role in the party. Build a balanced party that can handle various situations, such as combat, special sight, and healing.


Manage your inventory:

By default, KRL allows minions to load up on any consumables they desire, making it difficult to control item distribution. However, it's still valuable to manage your inventory strategically. Consider forming a party led by a sturdy unit who can distribute supplies wisely. Limit party members from squandering healing items and buffs for personal gain on weaker enemies. While controlling consumables is a good idea, it does require additional management with the current UI. To ensure your party is always prepared for the worst-case scenario, you can equip your leader with extra supplies like healing potions and scrolls and provide your party with adequate weapons and armor. Remember to loot defeated enemies to improve your inventory as the invasion progresses.


Retreat to safe areas:

Retreating is an essential strategy that is often overlooked in the heat of battle. If your party is struggling with a particular enemy, it's time to try a different approach. Don't hesitate to retreat all the way back to your base and regroup if necessary. Remember, a tactical retreat can save your party from unnecessary losses.


When retreating, it's important to take cover from enemy archers, spellcasters, and other ranged attackers to avoid taking unnecessary damage. If you find yourself in a fight that's too big to handle, don't be afraid to retreat to a more advantageous spot, like a chokepoint or bottleneck, or leave the area entirely. This will give your party time to heal and recharge their spells, allowing you to mount a stronger attack later.


Remember that you can't leave the map as long as the enemy can see you. Attacking at night can reduce the enemy's sight range, so consider dropping or unequipping torches to avoid being detected. Also, use trees and bushes to break sightlines. If all else fails, consider using one or more lesser creatures to decoy the enemy and give the rest of your team time to escape.


Take advantage of terrain:

Use the terrain to your advantage in combat. Position your characters behind cover, and draw enemies at chokepoints to funnel enemies into a more manageable group. Force melee units to advance by hitting them at a distance. Be mindful of environmental hazards, such as deep water, lava and burning trees. Try to use your surroundings to your advantage.


Learn from your mistakes:

When playing an adventurer without a dungeon base, you have nothing to fall back on. If you have a dungeeon base, the enemy may counter attack you after you lose an invasion. Death is often inevitable in roguelike games, so it's important to learn from your mistakes. Each time you die, take note of what went wrong and how you can improve your strategy. Over time, you'll become more skilled and better equipped to handle the challenges that lie ahead.
