"Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a subgenre of role-playing computer games traditionally characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permanent death of the player character. Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons." (Wikipedia December 2022)


Roguelike gameplay is especially fun when you're controlling a party of creatures.


In a party, know the members:

Each party member can have unique abilities and strengths. Take the time to understand each character's skills, stats, and role in the party. Build a balanced party that can handle various situations, such as combat, special sight, and healing.


Manage your inventory:

By default, KRL allows minions to load up on any consumables they desire, making it difficult to control item distribution. However, it's still valuable to manage your inventory strategically. Consider forming a party led by a sturdy unit who can distribute supplies wisely. Limit party members from squandering healing items and buffs for personal gain on weaker enemies. While controlling consumables is a good idea, it does require additional management with the current UI. To ensure your party is always prepared for the worst-case scenario, you can equip your leader with extra supplies like healing potions and scrolls and provide your party with adequate weapons and armor. Remember to loot defeated enemies to improve your inventory as the invasion progresses.


Retreat to safe areas to regain health and recharge your spells:

Obvious when you think about it. If your party is struggling with a particular enemy, try a different approach. Don't be afraid to retreat all the way back to base and regroup if necessary.


Take advantage of terrain:

Use the terrain to your advantage in combat. Position your characters behind cover, and draw enemies at chokepoints to funnel enemies into a more manageable group. Force melee units to advance by hitting them at a distance. Be mindful of environmental hazards, such as deep water, lava and burning trees. Try to use your surroundings to your advantage.


Learn from your mistakes:

When playing an adventurer without a dungeon base, you have nothing to fall back on. If you have a dungeeon base, the enemy may counter attack you after you lose an invasion. Death is often inevitable in roguelike games, so it's important to learn from your mistakes. Each time you die, take note of what went wrong and how you can improve your strategy. Over time, you'll become more skilled and better equipped to handle the challenges that lie ahead.
