"Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a subgenre of role-playing computer games traditionally characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permanent death of the player character. Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons." (Wikipedia December 2022)


Roguelike gameplay is especially fun when you're controlling a party of creatures.


In a party, know the members:

Each party member can have unique abilities and strengths. Take the time to understand each character's skills, stats, and role in the party. Build a balanced party that can handle various situations, such as combat, special sight, and healing.


Manage Your Inventory:

Don't give out all the items to your followers. These are limited, so lead a party with a tough unit that carries and hands out supplies. Don't waste your healing items or buffs by giving them all to some stupid goblin. He will just waste them at the first opportunity to look after number one. Be prepared for the worst. Your leader can bring extra supplies, such as healing potions and scrolls, and make sure your party is well-equipped with weapons and armor. When you beat enemies, don't forget to loot them.


Retreat to safe areas to regain health and recharge your spells:

Obvious when you think about it. If your party is struggling with a particular enemy, try a different approach. Don't be afraid to retreat all the way back to base and regroup if necessary.


Take Advantage of Terrain:

Use the terrain to your advantage in combat. Position your characters behind cover, and draw enemies at chokepoints to funnel enemies into a more manageable group. Force melee units to advance by hitting them at a distance. Be mindful of environmental hazards, such as deep water, lava and burning trees. Try to use your surroundings to your advantage.


Learn From Your Mistakes:

When playing an adventurer without a dungeon base, you have nothing to fall back on. If you have a dungeeon base, the enemy may counter attack you after you lose an invasion. Death is often inevitable in roguelike games, so it's important to learn from your mistakes. Each time you die, take note of what went wrong and how you can improve your strategy. Over time, you'll become more skilled and better equipped to handle the challenges that lie ahead.
