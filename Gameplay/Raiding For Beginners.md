Raiding For Beginners
----
Hi!  From time to time, people ask for help getting started in KeeperRL.  One question that came up recently was how to get started on your first raid as a Keeper.

For beginners, I'll assume you're a Knight or Wizard, and you want to go nail the local bandits, or maybe a low-level dwarf setup.  Evil/Fallen Knights are generally
easier to play than Less-Evil or Lawful Knights, but for current purposes either will work.

As a starting Keeper, you're pretty weak and poorly equipped.  That said, typical starting keepers (wizard, knights) have a few advantages over other folks:
1) You come with Heal Self from the start.  Typical mage-casters need level 4 or so (advanced sorcery/iron bookshelf) to fix themselves.
2) You've got a good strength: wizards start with a staff (so their magic stat gets used to attack) and knights have multi-attack, throwing two or three swings where most units only throw one.
3) You can set up a dungeon, recruit troops & staff, and upgrade your & their gear.  The opposition cannot.

*Starting out and killing the local Bandits*

The first thing to do is to get your keeper trained & geared.  It's best not to clearcut the forest; the trees and shrubs can provide good cover should you later need it.
You'll want enough wood for a workshop, a few beds, and 1-2 wooden dummies & bookshelves. There is no point in making clubs: most folks do similar (or better!) damage with 
their unarmed attacks.
Workshops can have as many people working them as are qualified and can fit around them; if possible, leave all 8 tiles adjacent open and easily moved around.

Once you have beds and a workshop, you should be able to recruit an artificer (Evil folks use goblin artificers, but the idea is the same).  You generally only need one in the early going, and the population-cap room is best filled with combat-capable folks early on.
A full set of leather gear (no need for the wooden shield) will make life much safer against the bandits, and all it costs is the time to make it.
Have your artificer make some spares: they'll be handy to outfit your troops and the artificer themself, and since quality can fluctate by a point or two, you may get better gear.  You can see all available gear, and assign/equip gear, for a given "slot" by clicking on the slot in individual creatures' pages in the creature listing.
Once geared up, take your keeper and hunt around the ? marks on the map, if you haven't already.  (Daylight is better here, just keep to the wooded areas. You can see them before they'll see and track you.)  The bandits will operate out of a cave, so check the ? around the mountainside first.
Once you know where the bandit cave is, leave it alone until dark.  Since you don't have a light source, you won't be visible at a distance.

The plan is to reveal yourself to one bandit at a time, then get them to follow you outside their cave, ideally past a tree or two (so their friends don't get involved--being surrounded is a serious concern in KeeperRL) then to kill them off one or two at a time, heal up, and repeat.

I can't tell you exactly how best to accomplish this on your map, because every map is different.  But I can remind you that bandits can't see through trees either, and they usually don't mutually-support that far outside their cave.  Keep an eye on your health, and don't be afraid to retreat or wait between baiting out the next bandit for your healing spell to recharge.
[Screencaps might help here.]

You'll notice that one bandit is purple.  That's the leader.  Killing him will demoralize, and thus debuff, the rest.  It will also prevent that particular bandit cave from repopulating, and it will grant a Bandit Slayer title to whoever lands the killing blow.

Slayer titles add 1 to every stat their holder has, up to the total rank they have.  However, only the first of a given type applies to any individual unit: Bandit Slayers should let someone else kill off bandit leaders.
If you run out of nighttime or find the bandits paying too much attention, go ahead and retreat.  Use the trees to break line-of-sight and fall back to your dungeon; even the goblin artificer can help in a fight if need be.
Repeat the process as needed.  With a little practice, you should be able to kill off the entire bandit population in a night or two.  That should earn you enough malevolence to attain level 2, and thus take a new technology.

Depending on your keeper choice, you may have Sorcery or Iron Working already.  If you have one of those, I recommend taking the other; if you have none, Iron Working
allows better weapons, armor, and training, whereas Sorcery allows access to spellcasters (including healers!) and basic training for them. I personally go with Iron Working first, but that's a personal preference.
