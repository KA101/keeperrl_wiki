Training
--------

-   Use wooden, iron and adamantium dummies to train in melee combat.
-   Use wooden, iron and gold bookcases to train in magic combat.
-   Use the archery targets to train ranged combat up to the creature's
    maximum level.  If possible, only allow one training position "open"
    per target, and keep the positions at least three squares apart;
    otherwise, trainees will waste time shuffling between shooting positions
    and not actually training.  (Ideally, create individual "lanes" with three-tile-thick walls separating them,
    with doors so a lane-user can be locked in and potential lane-poachers locked out.)
-   Your creatures' Defense stat will be boosted by the highest training currently completed.
    The Evil Wizard, for example, can get up to 7 melee training from iron dummies,
    and will get 7 Defense from that until reaching spell training 8,
    at which point they will derive their Defense from their Spell training.

Training efficiency
-------------------

-   Good lighting increases efficiency.
-   Creatures will train using all furniture that can still train them, cycling from one item to the next. Consider making one or two training items accessible and restricting access to others used to satify immigration requirements to minimize movement between training equipment.
-   High morale generally boosts creature performance. Consider morale-boosting features such as nearby dining tables, recruiting succubae, etc.
-   Monsters are unable to train to the highest levels without the better dummies and bookcases.

Killing an enemy
----------------

-   Kill enemies to gain experience.  Experience primarily improves creatures' combat abilities, provided they're kept in sufficient Luxury.
-   In general, killing folks whose stats are better than yours gives better XP.  It's entirely possible to level up from one statistically-improbable but well-played kill.  However, every kill is worth at least 0.01 XP: slaughtering hordes of weaklings will, eventually, grant a levelup.
-   Further, grouping up into a _player-controlled_ team will grant _temporary_ combat XP to lower-level members of the team, such that they're brought to a comparable power level for the team and can therefore more effectively contribute.  (This may be comparable to the "sidekick" concept in MMO games.)  This temporary XP will go away when the team is no longer being player-controlled, but also buffs without requiring luxury.
-   XP gains are based on the creature's top potential output: in particular, if a creature has enough levels to merit Luxurious Quarters but has not received sufficient quarters, their gains will still be based on the stats they would have if provided the full quarters, not the stats they have based on their current living arrangement.
-   While creatures will ultimately require more difficult adversaries in order to advance, it can be worth keeping potential low-level attackers like bandits, kobolds, etc. alive, so they can send more enemies and everyone can get a chance to level up.

Quarters
--------

-  As your creatures become more powerful, they will require increasingly luxurious quarters to fight at peak efficency.
-  Experience levels 0-5 are more or less "free".  Levels 5-10 will require that the creature have a designated quarters zone; a single assigned bed will do.
    -  Since the Quarters zone designator only designates quarters from not-quarters, single-tile quarters require empty space around them.  An entire row of beds in a barracks, for example, can only have every other bed as Quarters.  (Making the entire row Quarters will result in assigning the entire row to one creature.)
    -  Once you've created a quarters-zone, click anywhere in it to assign that particular quarters to a creature. The interface generally prioritizes creatures without quarters over creatures who require Better quarters, so it's best to mouse-over the creatures in the quarters-assignment window and look for "unrealized experience". Those folks are the ones who need more or better quarters.
-  Levels 10-15 will start requiring Luxury; at this point, it's possible to accomodate this with a 1x4 room (counting the doorway as one of the tiles), with reinforced stone walls, carpeting, a Luxurious bed, a candlbrum, and optionally a fountain.
-  Higher levels will require larger rooms to accommodate the necessary Luxury. It's possible to provide traiing or crafting facilities as well (which don't add to the luxury total, but may be desirable for other reasons), but it's best to have other crafting facilities available: reduces folks barging in to use the private ones, and lets you the player issue crafting orders without having to click through the quarters-assignment interface first.
-  Enslaved prisoners will operate at full efficiency without Quarters, but will require Quarters should you convert them.  Please consider this when deciding who to send to the tables.
