Training
--------

-   Use wooden, iron and adamantium dummies to train in melee combat.
-   Use wooden, iron and gold bookcases to train in magic combat.
-   Use the archery targets to train ranged combat up to the creature's
    maximum level.

Training efficiency
-------------------

-   Gold carpeting provides the best efficiency.
-   Stone flooring is good efficiency and is not flammable.
-   Wooden flooring is cheap and ugly and burns.
-   Good lighting increases efficiency.
-   Monsters are unable to train to the highest levels without the
    better dummies and bookcases.

Killing an enemy
----------------

-   Kill enemies to gain experience.
-   Your minions, and Keeper, will gain .02 experience for each pig
    killed. Eat your way through training!
-   The tougher the monster you kill compared to you, the greater the
    experience is worth.
