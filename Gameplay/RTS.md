Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where players play in real-time instead of taking turns. In KeeperRL, the real-time clock is broken down into turns for compatibility with the rogue-like element, but in practice these turns are not visible during dungeon management except as shown at the bottom of the screen where you can see time passing. Creatures move at different speeds against the clock, either acting 0,1 or 2 times during a clock tick. Clock ticks can be speeded up or slowed down by changing the real-time game speed.

"In a real-time strategy game, each participant positions structures and maneuvers multiple units under their indirect control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents' assets. In a typical RTS game, it is possible to create additional units and structures, generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources. These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose. More specifically, the typical game in the RTS genre features resource-gathering, base-building, in-game technological development, and indirect control of units." (Wikipedia Decemeber 2022)
