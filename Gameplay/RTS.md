"In a real-time strategy game, each participant positions structures and maneuvers multiple units under their indirect control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents' assets. In a typical RTS game, it is possible to create additional units and structures, generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources. These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose. More specifically, the typical game in the RTS genre features resource-gathering, base-building, in-game technological development, and indirect control of units." (Wikipedia Decemeber 2022)


Dungeon building:


Plan your layout:

Before you start building your dungeon, it's really good to plan your layout. Think about where you want your rooms to be and how you want to connect them. Think about how deep to dig and how to safely mine resources. You may want to leave some space for traps or other defenses.


Leave orders for mining and tree cutting:

Make sure you have built resource storage and that you have your workers busy in the mines if they are not needed elsewhere. Keep your dungeon expanding. Your mining efforts will get you iron, gold, stone and even adamantium and infernite. You need these things to make furniture and installations and to craft equipment and consumables.


Defend your dungeon:

Your dungeon will be under attack from computer-controlled enemies. Build defensive structures such as walls, traps, and baracades to protect your dungeon.


Train your creatures:

Your creatures will be your primary defense against enemy attacks. Train them in combat and give them equipment such as weapons and armor to make them more effective.


Manage your clock ticks:

In KeeperRL, clock ticks are important for managing your dungeon. Keep an eye on the clock at the bottom of the screen and adjust the game speed as needed to make sure your creatures are busy but not in danger.


Balance offense and defense:

While it's important to have a strong defense, you also need to be able to go on the offensive to defeat your enemies. Excessive introspection will not lead to progress. Build up your army and launch attacks on enemy factions to weaken them and gain resources, captives and equipment.


Prioritize essential technologies:

Figure out the essential technologies for each faction, that will give you an immediate advantage. Also consider the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents on the campaign map. For example, if your opponent has melee resistant or magic resistant units, you may want to research archery.


Dig out z-levels:

Digging out underground levels is a great way to expand your base. Start from the top down, you may like to clearing out each enemy camp completely before moving on to the next level. Prioritize digging out important areas such as resource deposits. It's important to be prepared for enemy attacks. Digging into their territory will trigger them. You will see their tribe appear on your list of villains.


Build outside:

Welcome to the world of dungeon building, where not only do you have to focus on creating a masterpiece underground, but you also ought to extend your base far beyond the dungeon walls to thrive.


Build Upwards:

Want to take your dungeon to new heights? Building upwards unlocks additional layers higher up in your biome, and building towers by constructing walls on the level below can help you set an amubush in the rooms above.


Keep Your Minions Safe:

It can be crucial to keep your keeper and minions inside the safety of your base, but accidents happen. Fortunately, you can unclaim territory outside your base to prevent your keeper from wandering too far. Locking the door to the outside world is also an effective way to keep unwanted explorers in.


Protect Your Minions:

Wildlife can be a threat to your workers, especially in certain biomes. Undead units are particularly vulnerable outside, so you need to take extra care. Beware of the sun - when it rises, many undead will crumble to dust. Use balsams to spread darkness around them if your faction has them, and assign any workers with an unlimited carry capacity to do hauling duty and reduce the number of trips they make outside. Be careful to avoid drowning undead units who have carelessly had their heads cut off. They can't see.


Make castles and towers:

You can lay a "building interior" outside using the structure menu, which has a roof that provides shelter for creatures that are vulnerable to sunlight during daylight hours. It also allows you to build rooms in the outside world that have furniture.


How to remove a Planned Building Interior:

If you want to remove a building interior designation, simply place a new one over the build plans, and they will disappear. The area will then remain an outside tile. Or keep your building plan and your minions will construct the actual building when they get around to it.


Expect Raids:

Be prepared for raids from other tribes on the map, as your external buildings are often the first to get hit. Tribes get "triggered" by your behavior, so be on your best behavior if you want to avoid being attacked. Alternatively, you can configure continuous raids in the game setup screen. Beating invaders is a great way to power up and make captives.


Understand Fog of War:

Enemies outside your line of sight are not visible, but certain factions can build eyeballs to monitor an area continuously. Use night vision at night and elf vision when surrounded by trees to see more easily.


Build External Defenses:

Experiment with pits, moats, and reinforced walls to give invaders a hard time.


How to remove walls and fill Pits:

If you want to remove a wall you placed outside, you can dig it like it is normal rock. To fill a pit, use the item on the structure menu.


Experiment with different strategies:

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to building your base in this game. Experiment with different strategies and find what works best for you. Try out different creature types and technologies and build different things to find the most effective technique for your playstyle.
