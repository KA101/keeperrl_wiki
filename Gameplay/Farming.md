Farming
----

Farming in KeeperRL allows the Keeper to invest wood into raising domestic animals for food, which justifies an increased population cap.  (Currently in Alpha
36, we don't actually require creatures to kill off and eat the animals, to save processor time and file size.)

Most keepers who have a population requiring food have access to three technologies, which must be acquired in order: chicken, pig, and ultimately cow breeding.  Each
technology allows building 16 tiles of animal-room, and each tile supports additional population.  As you advance up this branch of the technology tree,
the creature tiles become more efficient: each type of animal costs the same amount of wood to build its farm plot, but larger animals provide more food.

Farm plots currently spawn creatures, who expand to fill their available space.  Animal-fence constructions pen them in, as do walls.  It's perfectly fine to set up your
animal pens outside in the open air, but inside works too and may be cheaper.

*Strategy* (alpha 36)

Currently, farm tiles don't require creatures to access them to consume or care for the animals, so they can be set off to the side of the main dungeon or otherwise
kept out of the main "flow".  That said, chickens have permanent Speed Bonus and Flight, both of which are handy things to give a doppelganger.  Otherwise, the importance
of farming technology is generally a question of whether you'd prefer several lesser-geared creatures (who the farm can feed) or fewer but better-geared creatures (whose
gear you probably provided using alternative technology picks).
