Banner Movement
----

From time to time Keepers may want to instruct a unit (or group of units) to move to a certain point, but not want to take direct control using the Roguelike interface.


KeeperRL has a "go-to" function, which we'll call "Banner Movement".  You can click on and drag a creature or pre-formed team to a target point, which will mark itself with a banner icon.  Your designated creature or team will then go to that point and remain in that area for a few turns.


This allows Keepers to dispatch units or response teams to handle trouble points without having to focus all their attention on the potential problem.  Especially in later stages of the game, it's quite possible to have a creature or small team capable of resolving bandit raids or mining encounters: using banner movement, Keepers can dispatch such forces and keep their attention on the dungeon as a whole.
