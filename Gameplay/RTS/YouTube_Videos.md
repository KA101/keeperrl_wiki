Several streamers have posted KeeperRL 1.0 videos.

Discord member Semulin's 10 Things He Wishes He Knew has a fair amount of handy things for new players.  (But you do need to use Prison Doors on the prison, and the various torture gear, gallows, and cages don't need to be built *in* the prison.)

Nookrium has also done a beginner video; it's much longer, but might be time well spent if you're into watching videos to learn.
