In KeeperRL the amount of resources you have is *limited*: trees don't
grow back, all ores are shown. Through the use of alchemy there is an
exception with [gold](/keeperrl_wiki/Gold "wikilink") being used to turn
into other materials.

To gather resources you have to select them the *Dig or cut tree* tool.
Your [imps](/keeperrl_wiki/Imp "wikilink") will then start to harvest the resource and
carry it to your [stockpiles](/keeperrl_wiki/Storage "wikilink").

Gold
----

*You get gold by mining gold veins.*

You need to store gold pieces in a [treasure
chest](/keeperrl_wiki/Treasure_Chest "wikilink").

Gold is used to build [statues](/keeperrl_wiki/Statue "wikilink"). It is
the only way to seriously increase your population cap. Hoarding too
much gold will attract [bandits](/keeperrl_wiki/Bandit "wikilink"), and the throne
itself makes your neighbors hate you more.

The alternative but surefire way of getting gold is by *luring
attackers* into your keep and taking the ore from the bloody corpses, as
they very often carry their purse with them. A defensive keep strategy
will easily score a big gold count.

Wood
----

*You get wood by chopping down trees or bushes.*

The amount of wood planks per tile is more from trees than from bushes.

Wood is used to build [rooms](/keeperrl_wiki/Rooms_Guide "wikilink") (around 2/3
of them) and [installations](/keeperrl_wiki/Installations "wikilink"), like
[doors](/keeperrl_wiki/Door "wikilink"),
[bridges](/keeperrl_wiki/Bridge "wikilink"), etc. It's the first
resource you are gonna need as it takes some wood per
[library](/keeperrl_wiki/Library "wikilink") bookcase, enabling
[research](/keeperrl_wiki/Technologies "wikilink").

Iron
----

*You get iron by mining ore veins.*

The amount of iron ore per tile is randomized somewhat.

Iron is used to build [rooms](/keeperrl_wiki/Rooms_Guide "wikilink"), usually with
a military theme, such as the [training
room](/keeperrl_wiki/Training_Room "wikilink"), the
[forge](/keeperrl_wiki/Forge "wikilink").

Adamantium
----------

*You get adamantium by mining ore veins.*

Adamantium is used to build special dummies and finer, sharper, better
weapons and armour than iron. Naturally occurring veins are guarded by
golems that will wreck an unsuspecting keeper.

Stone
-----

*You get stone by mining granite veins.*

Stone is used to build 2 [rooms](/keeperrl_wiki/Rooms_Guide "wikilink"): the
[graveyard](/keeperrl_wiki/Graveyard "wikilink") and the
[laboratory](/keeperrl_wiki/Laboratory "wikilink"). It is needed for
flooring.

Mana
----

''You harvest mana by destroying an entire tribe

In free-play mode, you can get mana from studying in the library, if
this option is turned on during the game setup.

Mana is used to do [research](/keeperrl_wiki/Technologies "wikilink") and build your
[throne](/keeperrl_wiki/Throne "wikilink") once you can.
