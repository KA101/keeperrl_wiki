Single Maps
-----------

-   You can play single map games, with all enemies on the same map
    sector
-   Single maps are bigger than ordinary map sectors in a campaign
-   Single map dungeons cannot be retired and uploaded for others to
    fight against
-   Single map games are for Keepers only.
-   You can compete for the hi-score

Campaign Maps
=============

-   Campaigns are very similar to single map games but you have a master
    map containing other enemies and allies on various map sectors.
-   Keeper dungeons are controlled by AI
-   You can press 't' to travel between map sectors while controlling
    one of your creatures.
-   You can compete for the official hi-score
-   You can upload your dungeon to be challenged in free-play games

Free-play mode
--------------

-   These are custom campaigns
-   You can get to play against up to 4 hand-crafted dungeons designed
    by real people. (If you like you can usually choose ones which have
    never ever been played against previously - by anyone!).
-   You get to choose your starting location
-   You get to choose the number of enemies (within a range)
-   You can play “generate mana in library” where you can research
    technologies just by studying
-   You can still upload your dungeon if you win
