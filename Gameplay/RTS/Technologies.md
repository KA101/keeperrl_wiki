Note that on most games it will be possible to have researched all
technologies before the end of the game. However, you can often develop
a game-winning strategy by exploiting just some of your options to their
full potential.

Pig Breeding
------------

Build a pigsty for up to 4 extra population

-   To follow the strategy further, make statues and build a throne
    (later on).
-   If you want to try and overwhelm with numbers, you may lose or take
    heavy casualties, this is because the rogue-like underlying physics
    does tend to favour one OP hero over lots of little baddies
    (Rogue-likes are all about slaughtering armies of enemies with one
    guy if you think about it - and this is partly true with keeper).
-   You can go for the converted prisoners route. Cyclops, knights,
    dwarves, converted bosses. A high population will ensure prisoners
    can't escape and provide you with a way of capturing and converting
    bulks of prisoners. You will also need to build a prison.

Archery
-------

*Requires crafting*

-   Cost : 100 mana
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Bows](:Weapons#Short_Bow "wikilink")
    -   Archery range
-   The archery way is to torture and convert driads and elven archers,
    then train them in an archery range. You should be able to get +35
    ranged damage with their bow and have sight through trees.

Traps
-----

*Requires crafting*

-   Cost : 100 mana
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Traps](:Traps "wikilink")
-   The traps route is not really recommended since traps were nerfed.
    Lure them in to attack you and wipe them out with traps, but it is
    tricky these days.

Iron Working
------------

*Requires crafting*

-   Cost : 100 mana
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Forge](:Manufactories#Forge "wikilink")
    -   Iron Training Dummies
-   Early on you meet dwarves that usually have 2 handed iron weapons,
    so match their weaponry. You need iron-working and 2-handed weapon
    technologies. Iron working will get you the ability to build iron
    training dummies, so make sure you have trained up ogres to wield
    the weapons.
-   You also need this to go the adamantium route. The golems will need
    dealing with before you can max out training with the best training
    equipment and get the best weapons and armours.
-   You can go the werewolf route. Regeneration and stealth with decent
    training and weapons. Hit and run.

Two-handed Weapons
------------------

*Requires iron working*

-   Cost : 100 mana
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Two-handed weapons](:Weapons#Two-handed "wikilink")

Jewellery
---------

*Requires iron working*

-   Cost : 100 mana
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Jeweler](:Manufactories#Jeweler "wikilink")
-   Jewellery can be very underestimated. It is worth following. Poison
    resistance can be important and allows you to take on the ants and
    explore gnome/dark elf dungeons safely. This gives you superior
    resources from the ants and sometimes powerful items from dungeons.

Sorcery
-------

-   Cost : 0 mana (Starting technology)
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Basic spells](:Spells#Basic_Spells "wikilink")
-   If you want to go down the sorcery path, you need to get the best
    spell casters, namely a warlock keeper with vampires and a vampire
    lord and some orc shaman.

Advanced Sorcery
----------------

*Requires sorcery*

-   Cost : 100 mana
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Advanced spells](:Spells#Basic_Spells "wikilink")

Master Sorcery
--------------

*Requires master sorcery*

-   Cost : 100 mana or [Book of Master
    Sorcery](/keeperrl_wiki/Consumables#Book_of_Master_Sorcery "wikilink")
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Master spells](:Spells#Master_Spells "wikilink")

Demonology
----------

*Requires master sorcery*

-   Summon demons to your dungeon by building demon shrines
-   Research this option if you want to go the demon route. Get a
    dopple-ganger with permanent speed advantage maxed out and power up.
    Basically absorb everything that has good properties and not bad
    properties.
-   Also gives you access to ghosts and succubus.

Magical Weaponry
----------------

*Requires master sorcery*

-   Create weapons that hit using magic damage and increase spell power
-   Cost : 100 mana
-   Magical weapons combined with enchant weapon scrolls and fully
    trained warlock keepers and vampire lords are a real possibility for
    winning the game. Consider it as an option.

Alchemy
-------

-   Cost : 100 mana
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Laboratory](:Manufactories#Laboratory "wikilink")
    -   [Basic potions](:Potions#Basic_Potions "wikilink")
-   Take heal potions, slow down potions to throw, speed up potions to
    drink, melee resistance potions to drink, melee vulnerability
    potions to throw. Kit up on alchemy and mushrooms. This is the
    consumables route and if you want to do it, research the alchemy
    tree. The disadvantage is it costs you gold.

Advanced Alchemy
----------------

*Requires alchemy*

-   Cost : 100 mana or [Book of Advanced
    Alchemy](/keeperrl_wiki/Consumables#Book_of_Avanced_Alchemy "wikilink")
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Advanced Potions](:Potions#Advanced_Potions "wikilink")

Alchemical Conversion
---------------------

*Requires alchemy*

-   Lets you exchange gold for other resources in the brewery
-   Cost : 100 mana

Beast Mutation
--------------

-   Cost : 100 mana or [Book of Beast
    Mutation](/keeperrl_wiki/Consumables#Book_of_Beast_Mutation "wikilink")
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Legendary Beast](:Legendary_Beast "wikilink")
-   You can go the legendary beast route. Succubus pregnancy will get
    you some pretty nasty results.

Humanoid Mutation
-----------------

-   Cost : 100 mana or [Book of Humanoid
    Mutation](/keeperrl_wiki/Consumables#Book_of_Humanoid_Mutation "wikilink")
-   Unlocks :
    -   [Legendary Humanoid](:Legendary_Humanoid "wikilink")
-   You can go for the legendary humans as a decent strategy. These guys
    are a bit random but can also use equipment unlike the beasts.
