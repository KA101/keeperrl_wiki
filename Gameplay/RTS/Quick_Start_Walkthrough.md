Keepers are evil tyrants who commit war crimes. If you want to be a
hero, try playing an adventurer.

-   Choose your role. Choose “keeper” to begin with.

A new campaign map showing map sectors will be displayed. It may look
something like this one:

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Campaignmap-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Campaignmap-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Campaignmap-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

You can experiment with the game set up. When you click confirm a map is
generated for you and you will now be launched into the overhead view.
Here you can start building your dungeon.

Victory Objective
-----------------

Claim victory by conquering all the local tribes. Next, finalise your
defences and upload your map, so that adventurers and keepers belonging
to other players can then invade it.

Starting position
-----------------

You start with your [Keeper](/keeperrl_wiki/Keeper "wikilink") and 4 minion
[Imps](/keeperrl_wiki/Imp "wikilink"). The screen may look like this:

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Startingposition-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Startingposition-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Startingposition-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

You will occasionally see text in orange. These hints will provide you
with ideas on what to do next. When playing the tutorial, there are
step-by-step instructions at the bottom of the screen. Campaigns have a
campaign map, which contain other smaller map sectors and appears before
you start the game. The main villains and allies will be found on this
master map. View this during the game, using the compass icon.

Game options
------------

Press escape to view the game options. Save the game, abandon it or
retire (after winning). Change graphics and sound etc.

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Gameoptions-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Gameoptions-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Gameoptions-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

You can also pause the game at any time by pressing space. This will
give you time to think and issue complex orders. If it looks like you
are winning, you can increase the game speed to fast-forward it (until
you are invaded).

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Gamespeed-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Gamespeed-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Gamespeed-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

Later in the game and depending on your level of arrogance,
insensitivity and violence, many hostile forces start to get worried
about you.

Tabs
----

The four menu tabs in the top left corner of the screen are as follows:

-   Construction (pickaxe icon)
-   Minions (horned face icon)
-   Research (book icon)
-   Help (question mark icon)

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Tabs-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Tabs-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Tabs-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

Below the mini map in the top right are two buttons

-   Campaign Map (compass icon)
-   Find keeper (keeper icon)

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Minimap-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Minimap-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Minimap-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

Resources and resource stats
----------------------------

Along the bottom are your resource stats:

-   Gold

` Gained by looting enemies.`  
` Gained by creating a treasure room and asking imps to mine out the yellow gold tiles. `

-   Wood

` Gained by creating a resource stockpile and asking your imps to cut trees.`  

-   Iron

` Gained by creating a resource stockpile and asking imps to mine out the iron tiles.`

-   Adamantium

` Gained by assaulting adamantium golems and mining their ore.`  
` `

-   Stone

` Gained by creating a resource stockpile and asking imps to mine out the white stone tiles.`

-   Mana

` Gained by committing genocide against a tribe on the map.`  
` Gained by studying in the library if this option is turned on in `“`free-play`”` mode.`

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Resources-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Resources-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Resources-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

These [Resources](/keeperrl_wiki/Resources "wikilink") are what is needed to build
things in the dungeon. Mana is also used for researching technologies.
(Under the resource stats you can also see your population limit, which
turn you are in and how much daylight or night is remaining)

Advanced players may loot enemy dungeons by controlling an imp and
carrying resources back to base. (Imps can carry endless items in their
magic pockets because they have no maximum weight limit). When an enemy
is entirely defeated, you can select the tribes strip and use the
pillage option to loot the enemy instead.

Building Your First Dungeon
---------------------------

The main benefit of playing a keeper is that you can build a dungeon.
Adventurers can only invade dungeons.

The first thing to do is simply start digging! On the top right are the
various action icons. The pickaxe icon (the leftmost one) gives you the
orders you can give your imps. The top one is called “Dig or cut tree”.
Select that one and have the imps start digging.

You can be as creative as you want when it comes to designing the layout
of your dungeon. The imps dig fairly quickly if they are not mining
ores; stick to the plain black area and they can dig large
[rooms](/keeperrl_wiki/Rooms_Guide "wikilink") in a short time. You can hold down
shift with the mouse and draw out rectangles, too. Hold down the CTRL
key and drag to cancel blocks of orders shown on the map.

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Littledungeon-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Littledungeon-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Littledungeon-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

Construction
------------

Various [Constructions](/keeperrl_wiki/Constructions "wikilink") are possible.
Construct items by clicking on the pickaxe icon. Select squares for your
[Imps](/keeperrl_wiki/Imp "wikilink") to dig and cut. Assign dungeon squares for
storage of [Resources](/keeperrl_wiki/Resources "wikilink") and items. Build treasure
rooms, dormitories, training rooms, libraries, workshops, forges,
laboratories, jewellers, ritual rooms, beast lairs, graveyards, prisons
and torture chambers. The selected construction will highlight in green.
Click on map squares to give the orders.

Orders
------

Use the orders menu from the construction tab to claim tiles, fetch
items, prioritise tasks and remove construction. The selected option
will highlight in green. Click on the map squares to issue the orders.
You can set up forbidden zones and this is the best way to stop your
creatures angering nearby inhabitants or to keep them locked in a room
out of trouble.

It is possible to reinforce walls and block in tunnels, although it is
generally a bad idea to cut yourself off from the outside world
completely (If invaders can't get in, they will dig to destroy your
walls, which is usually worse than giving them an “easy” way in strewn
with traps). Some creatures like ants and dwarves sometimes prefer to
dig their way in anyway.

Installations
-------------

Some [Installations](/keeperrl_wiki/Installations "wikilink") require research to do.
Install doors, bridges, barricades, torches, eyeballs and your prisoner
heads in like fashion. You can also install various
[Traps](/keeperrl_wiki/Traps "wikilink").

Message boards can be built by Keepers and can be posted to by the
public.

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Installations-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Installations-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Installations-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

Building Rooms and Gathering Resources
--------------------------------------

Create storage rooms by clicking the “Storage” icon under the orders
menu, then mark out the space. The floor will change colour. You
normally want both resource and equipment storage. There is currently no
limit to the amount you can store on one tile, so you can design it how
you like. You can also store resources outside the dungeon.

Now that you have a storage space allocated, you can have the imps start
cutting down trees. Use the “Dig or cut tree” option, dig out the
mountain, and also mark trees. Do some mining. Rocks inside the mountain
will be visible. A treasure chest will give you somewhere to store the
gold, but be careful, bandits will scry your wealth.

Summoning Extra Imps
--------------------

Whenever you have enough gold, the [Keeper](/keeperrl_wiki/Keeper "wikilink") can
summon more imps. Simply click on the imp icon on your immigration
panel. I usually add 4 more imps, for a total of 8, very near the
beginning of the game, because this greatly speeds up your ability to
dig and gather [Resources](/keeperrl_wiki/Resources "wikilink"). I then usually add 4
more later on in the game but 12 total seems like enough for me to get
things done. I'd rather save my gold for other things later.

Library and Research
--------------------

The next thing you probably want to build is a library. The library is
crucial because the [Keeper](/keeperrl_wiki/Keeper "wikilink") needs it to research any
new techologies.

Have the imps dig out another room, usually at least 10x20 but it can be
bigger. Make sure you have some wood stockpiled as well.

Then simply build your library in that space from the orders menu. You
need a large library to research advanced skills and at this point wood
is plentiful so go ahead and build a large library, 10x10 at least. The
bookshelves will get in your way, so place them one-by-one at suitable
locations. The [Keeper](/keeperrl_wiki/Keeper "wikilink") will usually immediately move
to the library and spend most of the time there.

Now that the library is built you can start researching skills. Under
the “Research” menu, there is an item called “Library”. Clicking on this
brings up a list of all the technologies the your dungeon has acquired,
and also the technologies available to learn. Some techs only become
available by unlocking prerequisite ones, or by finding books in the
outside world.

If you remembered your tutorial steps, you will have attracted some
basic creatures to your dungeon already, and killed a few easy enemies.

You should have enough mana at this point to research some of the
technologies, which you can experiment with.

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Researchmenu-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Researchmenu-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Researchmenu-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

Minions
-------

You need to build other [rooms](/keeperrl_wiki/Rooms_Guide "wikilink") to attract
monsters into your dungeon. Some [Minions](/keeperrl_wiki/Minions "wikilink") will set
up home with you if you just give them a dormitory to rest in. Other
monsters would like places to train, or build things. Build a graveyard
to keep corpses and you may be able to raise the dead. Other types of
undead will come to practice rituals in a ritual room. Animals are
attracted into cages, where they can sleep (You may not want too many of
those at this stage, although cave bears are quite tough and flying
beasts will add their superior line-of-sight to a party).

Direct Control of a Minion
--------------------------

Select the minions icon (the horned face) to see a list of your current
types of minion and other minion information. Click on each type of
minion to see a list of each individual creature and their level. Click
on any individual creature to see the minion management screen where you
can control them. There are a list of extra commands when inside a
minion, such as casting [Spells](/keeperrl_wiki/Spells "wikilink"). After taking over a
minion's will, press “u” to return to the “dark god” mode.

Press 't' to travel to other map sectors on the campaign map. Note that
it is possible to select a whole team of minions, control them and
invade. To do this, click on the team on the left panel of the minions
tab, then select a team member and click “control”. Press 'g' to manage
every move of each team member and to toggle that feature off again.

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Directcontrol-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Directcontrol-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Directcontrol-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

Options on the minion management screen
---------------------------------------

You can banish, whip, directly control, rename, assign activities,
assign equipment, lock equipment and view spells.

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Minionmanagement-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Minionmanagement-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Minionmanagement-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

Population limit
----------------

There is always a maximum population limit that your dungeon can hold
and this is displayed on the bottom right of the screen. Any dungeon can
support a population of 10 creatures plus imps. You can attract and
command more creatures by building various rooms. Impressive statues of
yourself always increase the lure of your dungeon by 1 population.
However, a decent statue costs gold or mana (depending on which version
you are playing). Your monsters will not take your gold for themselves
but you can offer them food in a pigsty to lure in another 4 creatures.
When you are ready, you can build a throne for yourself and gain command
of up to 10 more minions. Note that your dungeon size makes the forces
of goodness feel threatened. Setting up a throne for yourself is totally
offensive to many tribes, good and bad.

Population management
---------------------

You may need to enforce discipline using a whipping post and keep them
happy by letting them get a piece of the combat action. Also, some
creatures may outlive their usefulness. You have the option to banish
them or send them on a suicide mission. Some keepers like to possess
weak creatures and then drown the in a lake or river. Other players
throw things at them, use them as target practice and kill them that way
(It is possible to get some experience from them, but you should expect
them to turn hostile and try to fight back).

Tribes
------

You will have to travel to other map sectors to find the bases belonging
to most of the bigger tribes and to do that, you will need to control a
team or minion (see “Direct Control of a Minion”).

Look on the tribes strip to see information about other known tribes.
Destroying a tribe will yield mana and allow you to pillage. Full
conquest of all the tribes will allow you to retire victorious (only to
be invaded by other players).

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Tribesstrip-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Tribesstrip-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Tribesstrip-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

The world we live in is inhabited by many [
creatures](/keeperrl_wiki/Creatures_Guide "wikilink"). For example, you may meet
bandits, dragons, dwarves, elves, lizardmen, humans, spiders, scorpions,
gnomes, undead, dark elves, minotaur, hydras, giant ants, elementalists,
witchmen, kobolds, driads and cyclops... (there are a few more). Some
creatures will hold you to ransom and attack you if you don't pay. You
can usually see the reason an attacker is assaulting you on the tribes
strip. There are allies you can recruit and shops where you can trade.

The “righteous” tribes will be happy to murder your kind, actually. Your
role and allies are defined at the beginning of the game. However, most
tribes can be provoked further by attacking or stealing things from
them, setting yourself up as a king or queen, hoarding piles of gold
etc.). If you are feeling really submissive, you can even pay them
tribute to avoid any confrontation, however a showdown is inevitable
eventually.

Prisoners
---------

Once you build a prison from iron, you can take prisoners. When fighting
with humanoids, you can right click them to order their capture (take
them alive). Once knocked out, they appear on your immigration panel and
you have a while to capture them, before they die.

Next, build a torture table and torture your prisoners to try and
convert them. Converted prisoners keep their stats and join your
dungeon! Otherwise, execute them on a gallows for their heads to be hung
up. Alternatively, absorb your prisoners with a doppleganger or else
just keep them to work in your mines. Some prisoners have spells and
useful skills, such as gnomes who are good at making jewellery.

If you have a small army and a large number of prisoners they may try to
escape.

Equipping an army
-----------------

When you have a decent population of creatures with different skills and
you have enough resources, it is worth thinking about equipment. You
have two options here:

-   Production queues

1) Some rooms will provide you with a production queue on the research
tab. Here you can command production of weapons, armour, ammunition,
jewelry, potions and some other things. It will cost resources, but your
creatures are generally happy to produce these if they have the skills.

-   Looting

2) Some equipment can be got from invaders. You can also control a
creature and go on a rogue-like assault of a hostile force nearby to get
loot.

Training an army
----------------

Some creatures learn spells in the library. Others gain levels by
training against dummies in the training room and/or through real
combat. Some creatures can train and learn spells, some can do neither.
Better training facilities will get better results.

Invaders
--------

Rumours about your dungeon will spread as it grows. These will attract
recruits but can also attract invaders. Invaders may be out to plunder
your gold, gain combat experience or just to assassinate your
[Keeper](/keeperrl_wiki/Keeper "wikilink"). Invaders may carry useful items to loot and
can also help you gain combat experience. If you are overpowered by an
invading force, such as a dragon you may need to evacuate your
[Keeper](/keeperrl_wiki/Keeper "wikilink") out of a back door. Sometimes invaders may
call off an assault. Most invaders are capable of tracking your keeper
across the map.

Exploring the Map
-----------------

Directly control a minion by taking over its will. Explore the map using
the arrow keys. Kill local monsters and tribes by commanding a party.
New teams are set up by clicking “New team” on the
[Minions](/keeperrl_wiki/Minions "wikilink") tab. Then select individual creatures to
add them to the team. Select the minion you want to lead your party and
click command to control them. Think carefully before trying to loot a
dragon's hoard or waking up a cyclops. Wolves naturally form their own
teams. Some nocturnal animals will want to go out at night to hunt and
also have good night vision.

Be careful while exploring, as you may bump into an unexpected
situation. If you are lucky you will find friendly tribes you can
recruit. You will also come across major enemies that you must defeat to
win the game. Minor enemies that you can tolerate but may attack you
occasionally and also small random settlements such as villages and
inhabited caves, which will not be able to counter-attack against you.
There are forest animals such as deer, foxes and boars. Don't get killed
by a dog while wandering about at level 5 with no weapons and armour!

<img src="/keeperrl_wiki/Killedbydog-screenshot.png" title="/keeperrl_wiki/Killedbydog-screenshot.png" alt="/keeperrl_wiki/Killedbydog-screenshot.png" width="1000" />

Winning the game
----------------

Some monsters that you meet will be pleased to join your forces. Others
will be hostile to you and perhaps hostile to the other settlements.
Note that you may tolerate the existence of minor pests such as an old
crazy cyclops. You must wipe out all the major forces on the tribes
strip. There are some monsters such as dragons that may die when they
invade you. You will normally need to go on the offensive at some point
by forming a team and controlling a minion directly to kill all your
rivals. Then you will get given a score, and that's how to become a
notorious villain in the world of KeeperRL.

Don't forget to retire your dungeon (over an internet connection) to
provide other people with the pleasure of bringing you to justice.

Enjoy!
