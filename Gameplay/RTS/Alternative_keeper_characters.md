KeeperRL Faction Guide:


In KeeperRL, players have nine different factions to choose from, each with diverse strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Selecting a faction determines the technologies, items, and creatures that will be available to players. In this guide, we'll take a closer look at each faction and what they add to the table.


Evil Wizard:
The Evil Wizard faction is all about command of sorcery and black magic. They have an array of noteworthy spells, and can rally demons to battle for them. This faction is an apt choice for players who appreciate using magic to kill their enemies. The downside the keeper is not a good melee fighter.


Goblins:
The Goblin faction both recruit and breed goblins. For breeding you need a matron. Their armies can include deadly kaboomers that use suicide bombing tactics. This faction is a superior choice for players who delight in annihilating their enemies with little green people.


Necromancers:
The Necromancer faction specializes in the resurrection and control of undead creatures. They can craft undead units using corpses, and their army includes huge zombies, skeletons, and other powerful undead creatures. This faction is a suitable option for players who savor using the undead to overcome their enemies. The downside is that they lack the power to create or recruit living units. Many of their units dislike sunlight.


Dwarves:
The Dwarven faction begin with a little population of skilled dwarves, who can acquire promotions and power up. Dwarves cannot breed new units or recruit them, but they can advance greatly in their chosen fields of excellency. This faction is a good choice for players who want to get to know their dungeon population. The inability to grow the population is a downside.


Gnomes:
The Gnome faction is focused on construction of automations to execute their commands. Their mechanical army includes tiny flying devices and inventions powered by engines. This faction is an fine pick for players who want to exploit engineering to defeat their enemies. The downside is that they have a fixed population of 4 gnomes, which are rather weak on their own.


White Knights:
The White Knight faction is more honorable than the others. They have better access to farmanimals, and their forces include powerful knights, archers and priests. This faction is a good choice for players who prefer a more nobel way. The downside is that they lack the truely evil units that some factions can control.


Fallen Knights:
The Fallen Knight faction is similar to the Evil Wizards, but they are better fighters and begin with iron working technology instead of sorcery. Their armies can be made up of similar recruits to their wizard counterparts. This faction is an excellent choice for players who want a savage keeper to lead their armies into battle. The keeper is not able to learn magic.


Cyclops:
The Cyclops faction is a lonesome keeper who stands on his own confronting the whole world. They are physically strong and can administer huge harm in melee combat. This faction is an fine choice for players who prefer a solo approach. Their big downside is that they lack any other units.


Zombies:
The Zombie faction is unique in that their ability increases with their numbers. They can raise hordes of zombies to swarm their enemies and subdue them with sheer strength. This faction is a suitable selection for players who enjoy overwhelming their enemies with brute numbers. The downside is that their units are comparatively weak on their own and there is very little diversity among zombies.


The faction that players choose will determine the technologies they can learn, the items they can build, and the types of creatures that will try to join their dungeon. Each faction has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, so players will need to carefully consider which faction they want to lead to victory.
