In KeeperRL, players can choose from nine different factions to try and lead to victory. Each faction has unique strengths, weaknesses, and abilities that can affect the gameplay experience. The factions are:


Evil Wizard: This faction is known for its mastery of sorcery and dark magic. They have a range of powerful spells and can summon demons to fight for them.


Goblins: This faction relies on brute force and numbers to overwhelm their enemies. They can breed goblin units using a matron, and their military options include powerful suicide bombers, who they name "kaboomers"


Necromancers: This faction specializes in the creation and control of undead creatures. They can craft undead units using corpses, and their army includes powerful zombies, skeletons, and other undead creatures.


Dwarves: This faction is known for their colourful personalities. They start with a small population of highly skilled dwarves, who can gain promotions and become even more powerful. Dwarves cannot breed new units, but they can advance greatly in their chosen field of excellence.


Gnomes: This faction is focused on building automations. These to do their bidding, and their army includes small flying devices and other mechanical creatures.


White Knights: This faction is more ethical and virtuous than the others. They have better access to livestock, and their army includes powerful knights and other armored units.


Fallen Knights: This faction is similar to Evil Wizards, but they are better fighters and start with iron working instead of sorcery. Their armies can be made up of similar recruits to their wizard counterparts.


Cyclops: This faction is a lone keeper who stands alone against the world. They are incredibly strong and can deal great damage in melee combat.


Zombies: This faction is unique in that their power increases with their numbers. They can raise hordes of zombies to swarm their enemies and overwhelm them with sheer force.


The faction that players choose will determine the technologies they can learn, the items they can build, and the types of creatures that will try to join their dungeon. Each faction has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, so players will need to carefully consider which faction they want to lead to victory.
