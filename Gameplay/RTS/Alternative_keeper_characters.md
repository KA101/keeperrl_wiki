Keepers are always warlocks (at the time of writing, in Alpha 24)

Please feel free to contribute to this page (which needs your help).

Thanks

Recommended bullet points:

-   Race/Appearance: Clues to what they look like
-   Spells: Existing or new spells they could have
-   Skills: What tasks an abilities are they capable of?
-   Tasks: What does he do off the battlefield and where does he do it?
-   Traits: Things that may influence combat or other gameplay
-   Diplomacy: How is (s)he treated by other settlements? What would
    they say about him/her?
-   Diplomacy: Are there any special commands on the tribes tab?

There have been some ideas for other characters. Please list them below:

Preface
-------

Many of these characters were designed with the idea of generalists and
specialists. Generalists are good a multiple things, but specialists
take a trait and push it to the extreme. The existing warlock should be
considered a generalist class, with the specialists balanced around him.
Some characters need to be defined.

In summary

-   The artificer takes the crafting aspect of the game and pushes it to
    the max, with the crafting skills defining this character. The
    downfall is he can't learn the same set of spells and can't recruit
    normally.
-   The pyromancer pushes the offensive spell aspect of the game to max,
    with this character having access to new set of powerful spells. The
    downfall is he can't build a throne to increase population cap, and
    he cannot have allies. (Even dark elves would hostile)
-   The rogue knight pushes the character as a general combat unit, at
    the expense of spells and mana production.
-   The Deceiver takes full advantage of the tribes tab.
-   The necromancer pushes the character to have affinity for undead,
    and make full use of them. The downfall is he cannot recruit living
    units, and his crafting skeletons should not be as good as goblins.
-   The Assassin changes the strategy of the game. Many players don't
    use their keeper to fight because if he dies you loose. This
    character makes early use and invasion much more viable. He is much
    stronger than the keeper, but his dungeon is not. His initial
    population limit is half and enemies are more aggressive toward him.
-   The shade is somewhere in between the Assassin and Keeper. His
    downfall is the immigration system is less likely to give him units
    to accept.
-   The Elementalist gets better starting units, but they can't train.
    Probably should get a small population initial nerf (-2) to balance
    the fact that all of his units are more powerful. Can't recruit by
    immigration. Starts with house, limit dungeon design.
-   Flesheaver/Mad scientist gets different rooms. Should he be pushed
    more toward the undead than the necromancer? Should he be able to
    craft scaab units?
-   Mesmerist: recruits by Hypnotism. Should be combined with the
    Deceiver to make one very unique hero? What pitfalls make him
    unique?
-   Vampire Lord. Like the existing minion. But how should this minion
    differentiate itself from the Keeper, necromancer, and fleshweaver?

Demonic Wizard
==============

Long ago in a distant land, I unleashed an unspeakable evil upon the
world. But a mighty warrior came to oppose me, and flung me into this
world. Now I will conquer this world to take my revenge.

-   Based on Aku from Samurai Jack.

This character specializes in mana production.

Immigration
-----------

This character does not have access to normal minion immigration,
instead, this unit uses mana to summon units. Minions that spawn from
rituals are the exception and are recruited normally. Optimize your
army!

Buffs
-----

-   Enhanced mana production. Gains 1 mana every 3 turns passively. (not
    including mana production skill)
-   Access to mana spawned minions.
-   Access to unique demonic enhancement skill tree
-   Initial population limit is raised by 2.
-   Has darkness skill
-   Demonic shrines cost 40 instead of 60.

Pitfalls
--------

-   After the first day (or two?), a legendary warrior spawns on map
    with your home and attacks you
-   Legendary warriors continue to spawn once every day at a random
    time.
-   After 2 spawns, legendary warriors come in pairs or with units.

“A warrior was sent by your nemesis”

-   Enemy Legendary Warriors that spawn from the system above cannot be
    looted for equipment, but leave behind potions, scrolls.

Enemy Legendary Warrior Spawning
--------------------------------

-   Enemy warriors are meant to be a challenge, but not impossible to
    beat
-   Recommend the initial power of a knight, with a progression that
    offers better levels and access to spells, equipment, potions, and
    scrolls.
-   Some will spawn with henchmen (After a few spawns). For example a
    holy knight can spawn with 3 standard knights, and archers.
-   After all the main villains are conquered, Random spawns stop, and
    player receives a message from the final boss stating he will invade
    their base in day.
-   Final boss is level 30, spawns with steel armor, telepathy helm,
    gloves of strength, boots of levitation. Stun immunity, fire
    resistance, poison resistance, disarm trap. All spells up to master
    sorcery. ( Sorcery Skill is 30%).
-   Final Boss spawns with 3 legendary units.

Minion Spawning
---------------

-   Minions have a shadow overlay as to appear dark, like they spawned
    from the wizard himself.
-   All spawned minions have the same base stats as their standard
    counterparts, and the black overlay is a visual effect.
-   All minions except undead and demonic spawn with the darkness skill
    (initially)
-   All requirements must be met before a minion can spawn. Undead need
    corpses.

    Spawns with base elemental summon spells, can learn up master
    sorcery. No crafting skills. Tasks - studying, sleeping, eating,

    medium cooldown.
-   Shapeshifting temporary changes the stats based on level and form.

### Shapeshifting 1

-   Become Immense: character becomes visually larger and stronger (40
    turns)

Existing warlock
================

This is the guy you get in Alpha 21. Let's keep him. :)

Dungeon Master (Minion support)
===============================

The true master of the dungeon. While the assassin character features a
strong Keeper with a less powerful dungeon, this character features a
stronger dungeon with a weak Keeper. This Keeper rewards gameplay that
lets him sit inside his hole while others do the work. Strength in
numbers!

Easy to implement
-----------------

-   Only new thing required is a sprite, and the buffs and restrictions
    to be added. Not a lot of resources need to be created for this
    character.

Immigration with buffed population limit
----------------------------------------

Immigration is normal. No restrictions. No enhancements. No affinity for
one particular unit type (like undead).

Buffs
-----

-   Initial population cap raised by 3 or 5.
-   Pigsty increases population cap by 6 instead of 4.
-   Throne increases population by 15 instead of 10.
-   Starts with 50 extra mana

Pitfalls
--------

-   Cannot research Master sorcery. Otherwise skill tree is the same as
    the Keeper's except for research unique to the Dungeon Master.
-   Keeper Unit cannot learn advanced sorcery, but minions can.
-   Base speed is lower. Regular Keeper speed is a 100. The Dungeon
    Master is 70.
-   Relies on minions to brew potions, no Laboratory skill like the
    Keeper.
-   Keeper unit can't train to level up, but minions can. Can still gain
    EXP by fighting.
-   Can't use two handed weapons. (No bow, relies on harpies)
-   Demon Shrines cost + 20% to build
-   Keeper Unit is very old, so he must rest. Other Keepers don't sleep
    on their own, this one has a sleep schedule like minions.
-   All villains get an attack trigger (Fear) when population
    reaches 19.
-   Visual radius/Line of sight is smaller for Keeper Avatar. Terrible
    eyesight. Like when a minion without night vision is exploring at
    night.

Supervision (Task)
------------------

-   Has the supervision skill/task, where he will go into an area and
    “watch” his units be productive. Raises morale of units in the room.

Unique Research (Minion Support)
--------------------------------

-   Poison Resistance for Minions - All minions gain poison resistance.
    (150 Mana)
-   Fire Resistance for Minions - All minions gain fire resistance. (150
    Mana)
-   Stun Semi resistance - Stun time/entangle time for minions is
    halved. (150 Mana)
-   Limb-regrowth- minion regrow limbs when healed by an orc shaman,
    then go to rest (if not in battle) to recover for a day (1000 turns)
    (300 Mana).
-   Stairs - add multiple levels to your dungeon, and build the
    labyrinth of your dreams. Each stair level adds another level to
    expand the dungeon. Max of 3 extra levels. (100, 200, 400 mana for
    each level).

Advanced Traps/Discussion
-------------------------

-   Because he gets a more powerful dungeon, maybe he should have access
    to an advance traps research. Perhaps some of those already
    suggested on the wiki. Would it be unique to this character or would
    the Keeper and all other alternative Keepers have access to advanced
    traps?

Unique Furniture
----------------

-   Supervision chair. (50 wood)

Bullet Points
-------------

-   Race/Appearance: Human like Keeper. Blue/orange cloak. Old man with
    a cane.
-   Spells: No spells at the start. Can only learn up to sorcery level 1
    but minions can learn up sorcery level 2.
-   Skills: Mana production (0.95), Sorcery (0.1), disarm trap.
-   Tasks: Sleeping, eating, throne, studying, supervision
-   Traits: See Buffs

    He is raising an army to do WHAT?
-   Diplomacy: No special commands on the tribes tab.

===============================

Trinkets and toys for all the girls and boys! This character is Santa!
Okay not really, he is genius bent on world domination.

No recruitment. Build a golem army instead

Discussion
----------

Should golem units be allowed to train?

Pyromancer (Offensive Specialist)
=================================

Pyromancers are great at blowing things up, bad at studying. This
character starts with healing spell, and firesphere. He/She can learn
haste and strength, but no other spells from the usual spell tree. The
first major difference between this character and the keeper is sorcery
skill tree progression. As you progress through the skill tree, the
sorcery skill increases.

Pyromancer skill tree is as follows

Recruitment through immigration
-------------------------------

Very similar to existing warlock

Starting spells
---------------

-   Healing, Firesphere
-   (Sorcery 20%)

Pyromancy level 1 (60 Mana)
---------------------------

-   Haste, strength,
-   Fire sphere 2
-   Fire blast
-   (Sorcery 40%)

<!-- -->

-   Fire sphere 2 is just another fire sphere spell with a separate cool
    down.
-   Fireblast - Cooldown is medium. Same range as force bolt. Launches a
    ball of fire that does damage (Same as fire sphere)

Pyromancy Level 2 (120 Mana)
----------------------------

-   Firesphere Group (Summons Three fire spheres at once, large
    cooldown)
-   Summon Fire elemental (Cool down Medium)
-   Fire sphere 3
-   (Sorcery 60%)

Pyromancy Level 3 (180 Mana)
----------------------------

-   Summon Fire elemental 2.
-   Summon Fire Wolves - summon's three hell wolves to attack all
    enemies. Act like the wolves in game except different sprite, causes
    flammable tiles to burn. (Cool down Large)
-   Fire Ring - Explosion around spell caster - like word of power
    except causes fire damage to enemies.
-   Super Fireblast (Fireblast that shoots in a 3x4 tiles in front of
    spell caster, knocks enemies back)
-   Fire shield: Makes the caster immune to arrows temporarily (same
    cool down as magic shield)
-   (Sorcery 80%)

Pyromancy Level 4 (360 Mana)
----------------------------

-   Summon Fire elemental 3
-   Passive Buff - firespheres are blue. Negates enemy fire resistance.
-   Form the phoenix - become a phoenix temporarily 100 turns. Speed
    buff, large unarmed attack buff, (Can't use weapons), Defense buff,
    flying. Trap immunity. Bolder immunity. Large cool down. Doesn't
    care about enemy fire resistance.
-   (Sorcery 100)

Bullet points
-------------

-   Race/Appearance: Human. Red hair.
-   Spells: See above.
-   Skills: Sorcery (See above). Mana production (0.10) No crafting.
    Can't wield a bow. Can't wield two handed weapons. (Need to have
    free hand for pyromancy)
-   Tasks: Training, Eating, Sleeping, studying.
-   Traits: Fire resistance. Stun resistance.
-   Diplomacy: Feared and hated. Pyromancy is outlawed by humans because
    of the destruction it causes. Pyromancers are so hated and feared
    all enemies are hostile, pyromancer can't have allies.
-   Diplomacy: Humans hate pyromancers. Forest critters (elves, tree
    spirit, hate them). All humanoids/lesser villians gain a new attack
    trigger when pyromancy level 2 is unlocked.

Pitfalls
--------

-   Can't build a throne. The pyromancer does not wish to be king, just
    freedom from tyranny. Use the minion space wisely.
-   Orc shamans can only learn up to pyromancy level 2.
-   Bad at studying, must rely on minions for good manaproduction
-   Enemy Aggression (See Diplomacy)
-   Cannot progress through normal sorcery skill tree.

Buffs
-----

-   Starts with firesphere
-   Access to pyromancy skill tree.

Other Research
--------------

Minion Fire immunity (200 or 400 mana)

Rogue Knight (Military leader, Tank, front liner) (Implemented partly in Alpha 25)
==================================================================================

A traitor who broke away from the human kingdoms, vowing revenge on
those who dared cast doubt his way. Better base stats and iron starting
equipment, poor at research and mana generation.

Recruitment through immigration
-------------------------------

Recruitment of immigrants very similar to existing warlock keeper.

Visuals
-------

Culd look like one of the human knights, except maybe dressed in dark
plate and with a full helm of some variety.

Special combat moves
--------------------

-   Optional feature

Bullet points
-------------

-   Heal spell, Strength spell
-   Skills: Melee 80%,
-   Tasks: Training, Eating, Sleeping
-   Traits: Humanoid
-   Stats: Strength, Defense, Attack and Accuracy increasing with
    levels. Average dex.
-   Diplomacy: “This so-called knight must be made to pay for his
    crimes!”
-   Diplomacy: Human tribes have extra strong invasion triggers (He's a
    traitor)

Deceiver (Political negotiator)
===============================

Recruitment through immigration
-------------------------------

Recruitment of immigrants very similar to existing warlock keeper.

Trick your enemy into stupidity on the tribes tab
-------------------------------------------------

### Provocation

Create an invasion trigger against your self.

### Peace Mongering

Remove an invasion trigger.

### Dark persuasion

Recruit from tribes that are not allied to you.

Bullet points
-------------

-   Race - Dark elf
-   No spells.
-   Skills - Diplomatic manipulation (Able to heavily influence the
    triggers to invade you and when)
-   Skills - Dark persuasion (Able to recruit from minor villains by
    using a large amount of mana and gold)
-   Tasks - Eating, Sleeping, Studying
-   Traits Humanoid
-   Stats - Poor combat ability (Problems are solved through talking)
-   With enough mana, she/he is able to manipulate who will attack you
    and when.
-   Diplomacy - I thought we were friends!

Shadow (Stealthy, subtle, fast)
===============================

Overpower the innocent by stealth and do it anominously.

Recruitment through immigration but powered down a bit
------------------------------------------------------

Recruitment of immigrants very similar to existing warlock keeper.

Reuses existing spells, traits, tasks and commands
--------------------------------------------------

The main features for a shadow already exist in the game. It is a good
choice for early development.

Bullet points
-------------

-   Spells: Dexterity, Speed, Invisibility
-   Stealth trait and night vision traits (Similar to werewolf)
-   Disarming trait (similar to goblin)
-   Crafting, Eating, Sleeping
-   Hide command (similar to adventurers)
-   Gaining levels increases dex and speed futher
-   Archery 50%
-   Diplomacy: “Never heard of him!”
-   Diplomacy: Invasion triggers are delayed by quite a large number of
    turns
-   Start at level 5

Assassin (Stealthy, single target elimination)
==============================================

Recruitment through immigration. Dungeon is less powerful
---------------------------------------------------------

The assassin's dungeon is less powerful. Perhaps traps are improved.

Combat
------

This character focuses on quick combat and single target elimination.

Buffs
-----

-   Starts with stun, healing, escape, and invisibility spells.
-   Starts with stealth, disarm trap, archery, melee, sorcery (0.20),
    skills.
-   Base speed is 120
-   Quicker Leveling

Pitfalls
--------

-   Initial population limit is lowered by 6
-   Mana production is at 70%.
-   Throne only increases population by 5, and pigsty by 3.
-   The population limit forces the player to rely on the keeper to do
    the majority of killing.

Notes
-----

-   Same skill tree as normal Keeper.

Advancing levels
----------------

This character levels up by combat/training twice as fast. This
character rewards risky play by using the keeper as a main battle unit
instead of hiding in the dungeon. The downside is that keeper is the
most powerful unit, there are no second chances when you die.

Diplomacy
---------

Assassin's are wanted men, so all humanoid villains are more likely to
trigger and attack your base (includes lesser villains). Kill or be
killed!

Bullet points
-------------

-   Assassin unit looks like Keeper except without the beard, and has a
    black cloak. Enemy assassins have a white cloak.
-   Stun, healing, escape, invisibility spells.
-   Skills: Stealth, disarm, archery 50%, melee 50%, sorcery 40%
-   Tasks: Brewing, Eating, Sleeping, Training
-   Traits: Humanoid
-   Stats: Attack, accuracy, speed, dex.
-   Diplomacy: “Terrifying, none of us are safe!” (Hated, but feared)
-   Diplomacy: Invasion triggers could be stronger (hatred) but decrease
    with dungeon size (fear)

Necromancer (Different spells)
==============================

Necromancer - A completely new way to play the game.Necromancy was been
suggested as its own magic school, but really should be its own class.

Recruitment by raising undead
-----------------------------

What would separate the necromancer from other classes is that he/she
cannot recruit all minions like the keeper. Instead, he/she recruits
minions by raising corpses. However, he/she can still have vampires join
he/she normally.

Starting kit and spells
-----------------------

Healing Spell, Raise Corpse, Robe, Sword, 4 skeletons with the
construction skill, 200 mana and basic sorcery.

Necromancy technology and spells
--------------------------------

The exclusive raise corpse spell is as follows

Magic school: Necromancy Special powers: Turns non-rotted, non-zombie
corpse into a zombie. Turns a skeleton into an animated skeleton. The
corpse type effects the minion added. For example, killing a human would
reward a normal zombie when turned, but killing a dog would add a beast
to the population. Different levels would have to be researched to raise
the corpses/skeletons of bosses, legendary units, and other keepers.
Will fail if population limit reached. Will fail if don't have a place
to store corpse. (Like not having a bed for a unit) Cooldown: 40 turns
Cost: 15 Mana per corpse, does not increase. Concept: Grow an army of
undead and rule both the realm of the living and dead! Purpose in game:
Allows the necromancer to grow his/her population. This is the only way
they can recruit units, can't recruit minions like the Keeper. Optional
features: N/A Discussion.

Under the necromancer, zombies would get a speed bonus and train faster
to make them more viable as majority unit. Skeletons would also differ
from zombies. They are less durable, faster, and have the construction
and manufacturing skills. Stats would be slight better than the goblin,
but crafting skills are half of a goblin and they would be able to equip
items. Skeletons also wouldn't burn in sunlight.

Most Existing technologies available
------------------------------------

The research tree would be the same as the keeper, except with a few
additions and that basic sorcery would already be unlocked. First, the
other levels of a necromancy can be researched. The only restriction is
master sorcery cannot be researched.

Necromancy of higher villains
-----------------------------

Level 2 lowers the cool down of raise corpse, and allows one to raise
multiple corpses at once. Also gives access to a necromantic blast
spell. Level 3 Lets you raise lesser villains, smaller necromantic blast
recharge. Level 4 lets you raise main villains.

Other powerful spells
---------------------

Necromantic Blast Cooldown: 100 Concept: Death spell for a death mage
Purpose: Gives an offensive class and offensive spell. Shoots a black
bolt 3x3 tiles in front of avatar. Non piercing. Damage similar to a
force bolt, but increases with each level of necromancy.

Secondly, the necromancer would have the darkness research trait/tree
available to research. Level 1 - Undead units resistant to sunlight.
They won't burn but they lose one stat when in sunlight Level 2 -
Necromancer can create a large dark aura that protects units from
sunlight. (Unlocks Spell, last for 200 turns, vampires can learn it)
Level 3 - Perpetual night. Cover the world in darkness (until death).
Aggro's all lesser villains and main villains because they like the day.

Buildings
---------

Buildings only available to the necromancer: Hole: Can dig a hole
outside for a zombie to sleep in. Functionally identical to a grave
except it can't attract vampires.

Imps or skeletons?
------------------

Discussion: Can have the necromancer use imps instead of skeletons, but
it ruins the flavor.

Bullet points
-------------

Suggested bullet points (Added later by Keeperman):

-   Race: Skeleton (hooded) (male). Female wears a black dress, black
    hair, light color eyes.
-   Spells: Healing, Raise corpse, Necromantic blast, Perpetual night
-   Skills: Necromancy, Dark research
-   Tasks: Training, Crafting, Studying
-   Traits: Undead, Humanoid, Source of darkness
-   Diplomacy: “An evil that must be destroyed!”
-   Diplomacy: Good tribes have stronger invasion triggers. Evil
    villains like dragons are less concerned than normal.

Some miscellaneous ideas from discussion
----------------------------------------

-   Recruitment of zombie packs and skeleton packs instead of wolf
    packs.
-   Recruitment of vampire lords
-   All undead units have special traits that make them a lot more
    powerful under a necromancer
-   Living units are nerfed or replaced by the “special trait” undeads.
-   Introduction of mummies for necromancers
-   Necro keeper starts with zombie slaves
-   Non-undead slaves look like zombies just for the fun of it?

Elementalist (Different spells)
===============================

No recruitment. Make an army of elementals with fusion technology
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Uses the existing elementalist creature as a template
-----------------------------------------------------

-   Good for re-using code.

Elementalist. Like the main villain in game. Aligned with knights and
humans. Only uses mana to cast elementals, with each spell as a separate
cool down. Spawns in a house, with a library and bed, a bit of gold, and
first aid kits, and alchemy bench. Can't craft items other than potions.
Gets mana by studying and some other source. Possibly using mana to
spawn shard pilliars that regenerate mana over time. Knows healing
spell.

No Training
-----------

Elements are air, water, earth, fire. Elemental minions can't train to
level up.

Level 1 (Fusion technology)
---------------------------

Fuse two elementals to create a stronger elemental. For example,

-   Air and Water is storm. (Dark blue are elemental sprite)
-   Air and Fire is inferno. (Red air elemental sprite)
-   Air and Earth is sand. (Tan air elemental sprite)
-   Fire and Earth is iron. (Spawn iron golem)
-   Fire and Water is ice. (Spawn sentient ice block)
-   Earth and Water is slime. (Spawn slime unit)
-   They are level 20

Level 2 (Fusion)
----------------

Fuse three elementals to create even stronger unit.

-   Air, Water, Fire
-   Air, Water, Earth
-   Fire, Water, Earth - Cactus beast
-   Fire, Air, Earth

level 3 (Fusion)
----------------

Fuse the elements with yourself to become super powerful. Regrow limbs,
gain 4 spells (Fireblast, flood, force bolt, earth quake\[Mass stun for
3 turns\])

Other technologies
------------------

-   Sorcery technologies also available.
-   Basic Alchemy unlocked at start.

Dynamic world
-------------

Enemies attack allies and you are called to defend them. For ex, dark
elves verse elves.

Bullet points
-------------

-   Race: Human
-   Spells: Summon elemental, fire sphere, New elemental spells (See
    above)
-   Skills: Elementalism
-   Tasks: Brewery, Eating, Sleeping
-   Traits: Humanoid, sorcery 100%
-   Diplomacy: “First we liked him, then he built a throne. Now he
    thinks he's king!”
-   Diplomacy: Can recruit from human tribes until war is declared.

Restriction Summary and Notes
-----------------------------

-   No recruitment - produce units with mana, produce mana by studying
    and shard pillars
-   Use minor wind elemental (tiny sprite of air elemental) as imp
    replacement.
-   No spells outside of healing and elementalism
-   No crafting workshop and forge items - can use/research alchemy
-   Can't build demon shrines because he “good”
-   Can't build a prison
-   Elemental units can't craft, but can be set to roam an area to keep
    them occupied or guard duty.

Discussion
----------

Maybe allow the character to build a dungeon, as that is a major feature
of the game. Dark elementalist?

Flesh Weaver/Mad Scientist (Different rooms)
============================================

Recruitment from corpse vats, flesh farms and slurry pits
---------------------------------------------------------

Corpses gain a secondary value of worth (which changes to 0 when
clean/only bones) with these you summon your units now.

Imps are replaced by homonculi
------------------------------

Created via mana and also will pick up corpses from outside. Aside from
that, they would function as imps with the same mana progression cost.

Replacing the usual rooms of dormitories, beast cages, graveyards and
ritual rooms would be the following rooms.

Corpse Vats
-----------

This is where you place corpses to store and create your new basic
units. This is the first step and only costs 20 wood to make. each one
also acts as the dormitory to hold your new creatures.

Flesh farms
-----------

This produces corpses(which could be fleshy might not be) for a
renewable amount of enemies. This would cost 30 granite.

Slurry pits
-----------

This would be where you get your legendary abominations, your flesh
golems, and oozing flesh creatures. once 6 or 7 bodies are inputted into
it, then you will gain one legendary creature in return. (an alternative
could be that major villain bodies have a quality and you need defeat
those in order to get a legendary creature. make it that much harder and
that much more damaging to lose on though as major villains are a finite
resource.)

Suggested Research and Notes
----------------------------

-   Added Later by Zachdk528
-   Corpses don't decay when held by homunculi (50 Mana)
-   Keeper Skill tree is available except for master sorcery
-   Legendary Abominations 50 Mana to be able to be produced, each unit
    costs 100 mana after 6-7 bodies inputed. Each Slurry pit has its own
    body count, and homunculi will add to one pit until it is full.
    However, there is an option to stack bodies on one pit.
-   Legendary Abominations start at level 17-25, with higher levels
    corresponding to more bodies
-   Legendary Abominations can't learn spells unless enough bodies.
-   All units are undead and have courage. Not all have poison
    resistance.
-   Units don't burn in sunlight.
-   

Suggested Units
---------------

-   Added later by Zachdk528

### Corpse Vat

-   Minor ghoul: Stats of a goblin, but all crafting skills are at 40%.
    (1 corpse).
-   Gleep: Orc Stats, but faster and + 13 unarmed attack. Can't wield
    two handed weapons. Can't craft like Orc. (1 Corpse)

Gleeps look a human meld from silly putty by a 3 year old. (1 Corpse)

-   Gloop: Harpy stats. Archery (0.70). No laboratory skill. (1 Corpse)
-   Shmoopee: Two headed being, twisted. Slow (Orge speed). Can only
    learn basic sorcery. Mana production at 50%. Can train, unlike orc
    shamans. (2 corpses)
-   Drake. 2 Wings, torso, head. Cave bear stats but can fly. (1 Corpse)
-   Oozing flesh: has a +22 unarmed and the absorb ability, standardly
    eats bodies to do so, but can also absorb opponents(or try to with a
    possible fail rate) other stats are like Ogres. (3 corpses)

### Fleshfarms

-   Produces fleshberries at the end of each day. Each tile can produce
    1-3 flesh berries.
-   15 Flesh berries = 1 corpse
-   Requires testing for balancing.
-   Also as possibility, could raise population cap as the pigsty does.

### Slurry Pits

-   Mauler: 4 feet, 1 torso, 2 arms, head. Can't equip or train. Like a
    beast. Fast (Speed 130). Level 15. 16 unarmed attack bonus.

Maulers have a jumping attack which they can jump 5 tiles a head. (2-3
Corpses). sleeps in beast cage.

-   Goliath: 6 arms, 3 heads, 2 arms. Can equip. Level 12 but can train.
    Normal speed. 8 unarmed attach bonus. (6 Corpses)
-   Flesh Golem: This many faced large abomination is unique in that it
    requires specific body parts(PErhaps a butchery room will be
    required to break down bodies into necessary parts) and has WAY more
    health then is commonly available to the masses. Mayhaps use cyclops
    stats for this.

### Legendary Abominations

-   Different Schemes like Legendary units in game
-   Each schema has different number of body parts.
-   Scaab - flying humanoid with 2 arms, 2 legs, torso.
-   4 armed creature
-   4 armed, 2 torso, 4 head, 8 legs.

Suggested bullet points
-----------------------

(Added later by Keeperman):

-   Race/Appearance: White Robed Scientist
-   Spells: Share some spells with necromancer.
-   Skills: Studying, Necromancy, Flesh weave
-   Tasks: Training, Eating, Sleeping
-   Traits: Humanoid
-   Diplomacy: “We must stop this Madman!”
-   Diplomacy: Good tribes will want to fight you. Evil and neutral
    villains will not be very interested.

Mesmerist (Psychic powers)
==========================

The mesmerist would rely on mental magics, but the main trick of a
mesmerist is to be able to(at range) hypnotize and control enemy units.

Recruitment through brainwashing creatures on the map
-----------------------------------------------------

NEW SPELLS:

Hypnotism
---------

This will work on your common elf children and animals, but with that
comes the plus of having a nice inexhaustible work force.(debatable if
they would level up in your base or not, but it is possible.

Disguise
--------

This allows you to disguise yourself into a nonviolent or relevant npc
and avoid enemies for a few turns. This may not work on the wilier
enemies but those bandits and dwarfs don't stand a chance versus this
illusion.

Chaos
-----

This changes an area of creatures alignments, causing infighting and
battle to commence! watch those treants rip each others branches off as
they stupidly bumble about. those dwarves will be too busy hitting each
other, and you can run off, snickering and ready to go get your army.

Dancing lights
--------------

Need those pesky parents and other beings out of the way? this illusion
would cause a set of two lights that go in the casted direction. all
enemies must, and i repeat MUST follow this. once it ends the enemy of
ocurse returns to you, but a bit of breath space is helpful.

Mass Brainwash
--------------

This is the true bread and butter to your mesmerist. This would be able
to tame and grab those bandit hoards for you that come knocking at your
door. of course you need beds for your new work force...but once you
have them, you have them.

Lastly, I must say that hypnotizing hydras and dragons are a possibility
but i leave it out of this as that would create quite an inbalance of
power. whether that is something you can do as you wont have access to
legendary creatures, is arguable but up to the developer if he picks
this up.

New buildings
-------------

Pendulum: waiting for a population cap to rise via pigstys is only one
worry, as you need to also keep your hypnotized slaves placated. There
will be an innate chance that your slaves(once population cap is
reached) will break free of your control.

Eye of Chaos Structure: Instead of Eye of Evil to reveal an area: you
can place an Eye of Chaos, which basically casts Chaos in it's visiblity
area(The circle around it at night that it can see, not the daytime
visibility I mean)

Pit of insanity: this is a trap that casts a single square of chaos,
making bandits in-fight and others as well instantly against the unit.

Suggested bullet points
-----------------------

(Added later by Keeperman):

-   Race: Dark figure with red eyes
-   Spells: Sleep, Mass brainwash, Mind smash, Hypnosis, Dancing Lights,
    chaos
-   Skills: Mind control, Sorcery
-   Tasks: Eating, Studying
-   Traits: No sleep, telepathy
-   Diplomacy: Can sometimes “Placate” invasion triggers using mana from
    the Tribes tab
-   Diplomacy: “We ought to go to war against him, although I am feeling
    a bit...sleepy....”

Vampire Lord (Much like the exising minion)
===========================================

Be The Master of the Night.

Recruitment of immigrants
-------------------------

If a graveyard (Necropolis) is Built of any size You will be able
attract more vampires more easily than any other minion. If a Ritual
room is built you will be able to summon more Demons and Ghosts more
easily. Some other units could be harder to get.

Other vampire Lords hostile or missing
--------------------------------------

If you choose this form at the start of the game, you won't be able to
find the Vampire lord minion in the graveyard, instead it will be a
normal vampire. because YOU are the Vampire lord!.

You start the game at night
---------------------------

Best feelings.

Good reuse of existing features
-------------------------------

Similar in most ways to the Vampire lord minion.

Bullet points
-------------

-   Race/Appearance: “Human” Vampire, Stylish Cape
-   Spells: Hypnotise, Bat form, Mist form, Blood Magic
-   Skills: Combat Bite, Unnatural speed/Strength, Night Vision,
    Unnatural hearing (can see invisible enemies)
-   Tasks: Studying, Training, Sleeping, Feeding, (on Prisoner “Cattle”
    Perhaps?) Torture
-   Traits: Humanoid, Terrifying
-   Features: Easier to get Vampire and demon Minions with graveyards
    and Ritual rooms have Vampire themed Dungeon objects, instead of
    grave stones have them be Coffins for vampires, a new Vamp themed
    throne, Tall Candelabras instead of torches etc
-   OPTIONAL Feature: As the Vampire lord, every night you can go out
    and turn sleeping human villagers into vampire minions. Either
    instantly turn them or have it take one full day before they turn
    and join your forces. OR you can turn them into Prisoner(Cattle) for
    feeding your ever expanding vampire army, Prisoner(Cattle) will
    immediately start following you back to base upon choosing this
    option. Can be an attack trigger.

Non-limiting classes
====================

Instead of a Keeper's starting class limiting what magics, minions and
technologies they can access, I request a complex tech tree which allows
the Keeper to explore most any knowledge, no limitations, but which is
so expansive that the player must generally devote the Keeper to a few
major branches in order to achieve the goals that will earn them fear,
dread and hate that they rightfully deserve. I will provide a suggestion
for how to build a fun tech tree to support freeform Keeper research and
development in the game mechanics section.

A Dragon
========

-   Race/Appearance: A black Dragon
-   Spells: Has little spells until more treasure is gained, starts with
    fire breathe
-   Skills: More gold in storage increases spells and general abilities
-   Stats: A little less than a dragon, but stats increase by hoarding
    gold
-   Tasks: He hangs around in his treasury while occasionally just
    devouring a minion, gains buffs from collected treasure
-   Traits: Terrifying, can't equip things, still hoards items for buffs
-   Diplomacy: Automatically gets attacked by the “good” factions along
    with random heroes. Though faction attacks stop after proving your
    dragon strength, this makes heroes stronger though, heroes are of
    certain races and wield weapons of said race, after that race is
    extinct no more heroes.
-   Diplomacy: Can demand tribute or slaves from factions
-   Recruitment: Can only enslave creatures to work in his cave, starts
    with a few enslaved kobalds to work. He enslaves by beating a strong
    enemy then activating a skill, or just using it on a weaker enemy.
    Slaves may rebel if they are strong and there are many, the chance
    increases if the dragon is gone, decreases if a revolt is crushed
    aka lowering slave moral back down
-   Extra: Enemies try to steal treasure, including random thieves using
    invisibility
-   Purpose: ever want to play as a dragon? Also some treasure oriented
    gameplay

Feel free to add more to this I kind of rushed it

Necromancer
===========

A Keeper with a focus on undead summons and fast creation of weaker
units. Takes time and effort to create larger undead creatures, but they
end up more durable and stronger.

-   Race/Appearance: Possibly a Lich or other classic DnD BBEG Undead.
-   Spells: Resurrection of units if they die within a range of the
    Necromancer. Make crusading and taking the Keeper out of the dungeon
    a bit more viable (raids/etc.)
-   Skills: Creation of buildings related to profession. Mausoleums,
    crypts.
-   Tasks: Research into the undead, slowly progresses knowledge towards
    other undead creatures, abilities, etc.
-   Traits: Phylactery. Hide it somewhere on the map and make that the
    target instead of the Keeper. Keeper will respawn after a set amount
    of turns after losing physical form. When respawned will take the
    body of an existing summon, takes time and gold to create another
    Lich host.
-   Diplomacy: Human Guise, treated as normal humans would be by other
    races. If any race discovered the Lich behind the face, they would
    become vilified, just like a normal Keeper.
-   Diplomacy: Command Undead from local Graveyards. Can freely
    immigrate a set number of Undead every so many days.
