When managing a dungeon, different immigrants will approach you and offer to join your tribe. Which immigrants you get offers from and are able to recruit depends on a number of factors:

	What type of keeper you are playing
	What types of furniture, structures and installations you have
	How many other similar minions exist in your dungeon.
	What technologies you have researched
	Which resources you have in what quantities
	How long your dungeon has been established for
	Whether it is nighttime or daytime
	Whether there is an ally on the map who wishes to do a deal
	Whether any minion is pregnant and able to give birth to it
	What bows and weaponry are available in your dungeon for them to use
	Whether there is anywhere for the creature to spawn
	Whether corpses and graves are available for an undead to spawn from
	Luck
