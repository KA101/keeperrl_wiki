Counter-Attacks
----

In certain circumstances, Villainous forces such as Bandits, Ants, or perhaps the Duke may send attacking parties to raid your dungeon, whether for valuables, prisoners, or to end your reign of terror.  While there are benefits to defending your dungeon (easier salvage and capture opportunities, fighting in terrain you designed and built, etc), eventually you'll probably want to end the attacks so you don't have to stay on guard for enemy attackers.

You could, of course, send an assault team and attack the enemy site.  However, some sites are a serious threat when guarded.  It'd probably be easier to attack if they didn't have so many troops.  Thus, counter-attacking.
