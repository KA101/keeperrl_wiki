Download instructions
=====================

Alpha 26 has introduced new modding support. Download the zip files and
copy them to your “KeeperRL\\data\_free” folder. To apply a mod, unzip
it to “data\_free” folder and replace any existing mod files that are
already there. Restart KeeperRL for good measure. Leave the zip files in
that “data\_free”, so you can switch to any desired mod whenever you
want to, just by extracting the zip file.

Enjoy!

Below: What the extract window might look like. Note: Do NOT extract to
a new folder. Extract to “data\_free” and overwrite.
