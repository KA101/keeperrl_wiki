For stats &quot;Terrible&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Excellent&quot; will do as much as numbers.

=Super villains (New concept)=
Super villains are obnoxiously powerful. They are gods that created the world and let it be. But you upset the world by taking it over, and pissed them off. Super villains only appear after all main villains are destroyed, and pose a final challenge for keepers. Super villains are only available in Free play, will only appear if enabled, and dungeons have a star after defeating them. Options include invasion after receiving a letter from the Gods, or the ability to invade the realm of the gods after building a portal. 
*Concept: A postgame challenge for hardcore players.

Ex. Zeus
*Level 35
*Stats: Large, all excellent,
*Speed = 130
*Traits (Weapon Melee 100%, Archery 100%, Sorcery 100%).
*Skills (Poison Resistant, Fire Resistant, Stun Resistant, Disarm Trap)
*Items (Battle Axe [20,20], Steel plate (+8), Gloves of strength, telepathy helmet, Boots of levitation)
*Knows all spells in game
*Loot: 2000 gold
*Spawns with 10 air elementals.

King has two legendary dukes surrounding him, with a population of knights, wizards, and archers.  Wizards have stats of Orc Shaman, know sorcery level 1, have healing skill, and, know fire sphere. The king becomes very aggressive when you build a throne. The purpose of this is to make a very strong main villain, to increase difficulty.
