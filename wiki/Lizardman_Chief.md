Summary
=======

A particularly tough lizardman elected to tribal chief because he was
bigger and meaner than his peers. With a base damage of 30, you should
try to take him alive and find him a decent weapon. Plus he can train an
amazing 10 levels in your training rooms and also level up further on
actual combat.
