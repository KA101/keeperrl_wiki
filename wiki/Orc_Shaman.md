''Standard healer minion

Some potions and a good book and his day is complete.

Summary
-------

Basic spell caster minion that you can recruit early on. A good choice
of healer for your teams. Later on they learn more advanced spells and
can occasionally get excited and set alight to your library, or perhaps
worse - set alight to the forest near your dungeon base, giving you a
wood shortage.
