KeeperRL Historical Mythos
___________________________________________________________

KeeperRL is an evolving world. (This game receives regular updates)

There have been a total of 34 distinct periods in KeeperRL's history. (Each period is represented by an Alpha release of the game)

Far back in the past, the minor tribes were closer together, the various lands were ruled by Dukes. The greatest threat to humanity was the terrible Red Dragon. Various other colours of dragons have appeared over the ages. The Evil Mage Keepers built dungeons to contest dominance of their lands.

The dark mages began to develop technologies and to advance in power. My records of KeeperRL history date back to a period known as A21.

Since A21, there has been a rush of immigrants into the Keeper dungeons, which enables the Keepers the luxury of accepting or rejecting the immigrants as they see fit. Each immigrant takes with it special skills and traits that provides the dungeons with various advantages and disadvantages.

A21 saw the dreaded doppleganger demons rise to power within the mage dungeons, creatures that possess the ability to change form and absorb other creatures to gain access to their special traits. Mage dungeons with dopplegangers are still very powerful to this day.

The period known as A22 saw the publication of the basic tutorial for Dark Mages to set up dungeons and aim to conquer their lands. This wicked guide helps new, inexperienced leaders to cause havok. The tutorial has been improved somewhat over time and is available to any would-be Keeper who wants a shot at conquest.

It wasn't until A23 that Keepers began to be challenged by seemingly endless waves of invaders who seek to destory their trap-ridden dungeons.

Following A23, the mages learnt the skills of taking prisoners, torturing them, keeping them alive and converting them to their cause, rather than simply using prisoners as slave labour. The traits, powers spells and personalities of converted prisoners normally remain intact. They simply change side in the war and work for their new Keeper instead.

Dark Knight Keepers later brought with them the skills of building moats. The KeeperRL universe then began to split into a kind of multiverse where each variation of the universe is known as a 'mod'. Many new and diverse KeeperRL universes now exist. (Players are able to mod the game configurations using modding support).

This now takes us up to the period known as A27, where White Knights, Dark Knights and Dark Mages began digging downwards into the earth. With their Cartesian co-ordinate system, these lower dungeons levels are still known as 'Z-Levels'. The x,y and z co-ordinates indicating distances east, north and downwards from an origin point.

A30 saw Gnome Keepers striving for dominance alongside the Knights and Mages. The gnomes specialise in building various kinds of magical machines that fight and work for them, quite unlike the other types of Keepers that came before them.

The various types of Keepers who have taken over their lands, sometimes choose to become warlords and to carry on their campaigns by attacking other Keepers even after they have subdued their own domains.

From A30 to A33, Goblin Keepers, Dwarf Families and then Necromancer Keepers entered the lands to conquer them. All these different factions still strive for control of the various lands in the World of KeeperRL. (Each of these Keeper factions can still be played)

We now live in a period known as A35, where horseback riding and the building of high towers and climbing of mountains are all useful in gaining control of the land. It isn't just horses that can be mounted, many beasts make good steeds and this opens up a lot of extra options on the battlefield.
