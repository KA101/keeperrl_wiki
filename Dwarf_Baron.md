Summary
-------

The most dangerous of all dwarves. Not to be messed with. Worth hitting
with magic if possible. He looks not unlike his tribesmen, so make sure
you pick him out of the crowd and take the necessary care. If you can
convert this guy, he is a serious asset to your dungeon, so you may want
to risk trying to take him alive and putting him to the torture table
for some education.
